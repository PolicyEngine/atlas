- [ ] Budget using PBIF template

## Recommendations for Alignment

1. **Add specific 250-word responses** for each question rather than longer narrative sections
2. **Include letters of support** from Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, NBER, Better Government Lab
3. **Create project timeline** showing specific milestones
4. **Download and complete PBIF budget template**
5. **Add team bios** for Max Ghenis, Pavel Makarchuk, and key hires

Our current application comprehensively addresses all PBIF requirements but should be reformatted to match their specific question structure and word limits.
