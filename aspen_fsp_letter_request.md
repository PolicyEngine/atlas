Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - PBIF Application & Letter of Support Request

Hi Tim,

Thanks for the Aspen Benefits Leadership Forum invite - looking forward to it!

Quick ask: We're applying to PBIF for the PolicyEngine Policy Library - using AI to permanently archive policy documents across 50+ jurisdictions. Every benefits tool depends on accurate policy docs, but they constantly disappear. Our approach leverages PolicyEngine's rules engine to intelligently surface ALL relevant documents (including non-obvious ones like TANF regs affecting SNAP eligibility).

Draft at policyengine.github.io/policy-library

Partners include Atlanta Fed, MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Georgetown, USC. $675k over 2 years.

Would love your take - are we solving the right problem? Any blind spots?

If you see value and potential Aspen collaboration, a letter would be great (draft below), but mainly want your strategic input. Due Saturday - sorry for late notice!

Best,
Max

P.S. - Key differentiator from other efforts: We're building on PolicyEngine's existing rules engine that already maps complex policy interactions (like TANF providing categorical eligibility for SNAP), so the library will intelligently surface ALL relevant documents for any eligibility decision, not just obvious ones.

## Draft Letter of Support (only if you think it makes sense)

[On Aspen Institute Letterhead]

**Letter of Support for PolicyEngine Policy Library**

To Whom It May Concern:

The Aspen Institute Financial Security Program is pleased to support PolicyEngine's application for Public Benefit Innovation Fund funding to develop the PolicyEngine Policy Library.

Our work on benefits access and financial security has consistently identified a critical infrastructure gap: the lack of reliable, permanent access to policy documents. Government websites frequently reorganize, links break, and essential documentation disappearsâ€”creating barriers for both families seeking benefits and organizations trying to help them. This problem compounds administrative burden and contributes to the significant gap between benefit eligibility and enrollment.

The PolicyEngine Policy Library addresses this fundamental challenge by creating a permanently archived, AI-powered collection of safety net policy documents. This infrastructure would:

- Provide stable, permanent access to statutes, regulations, and implementation guidance
- Enable benefits navigators and caseworkers to access authoritative, current information
- Support research on policy evolution and administrative burden
- Ensure AI tools assisting families have accurate, comprehensive policy context

We believe this project aligns strongly with PBIF's goals of reducing administrative burden in safety net programs and represents important infrastructure for the benefits access ecosystem. The combination of AI-powered document extraction, human verification, and stable API access creates a sustainable solution to a persistent problem.

The Aspen Financial Security Program supports this application and looks forward to seeing this critical infrastructure developed.

Sincerely,
