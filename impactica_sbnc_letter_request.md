Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - Enhancing Navvy with source documents

Hi [Contact Name],

Hope all is well! Navvy's been doing great work helping students navigate SNAP eligibility using our API.

We're applying to PBIF for the PolicyEngine Policy Library - AI-powered permanent archiving of benefit policy documents. Would love to explore how this could enhance Navvy: policyengine.github.io/policy-library

For Navvy/SBNC, the library could:
- Display actual SNAP policy documents alongside eligibility results
- Show students the specific rules affecting their eligibility (especially complex student exemptions)
- Provide authoritative sources for campus benefits navigators training students
- Archive state-specific student SNAP guidance that frequently disappears

We could offer Impactica a microgrant ($20-30k) to:
- Integrate document display into Navvy's workflow
- Contribute any student-specific SNAP documents you've collected
- Test the API with real student use cases
- Help shape the library to serve student needs

This would make Navvy even more powerful - students wouldn't just learn they're eligible, they'd see the actual policies and understand their rights. Campus navigators could reference authoritative documents when advocating for students.

Other partners include Atlanta Fed, MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Georgetown, USC, NBER, and potentially Urban Institute.

Interested in collaborating? Could also just be a letter of support if integration isn't feasible right now. Due Saturday (apologies for timing!).

Best,
Max

Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - Supporting campus benefits navigation

Hi [SBNC Contact],

We're working with Impactica on Navvy, which uses PolicyEngine's API for SNAP calculations. Applying to PBIF for a complementary project that could help campus benefits navigators: the PolicyEngine Policy Library.

The library would permanently archive SNAP policies, especially those affecting students (exemptions, work requirements, categorical eligibility through campus programs). Your navigators would have reliable access to source documents for training and student advocacy.

Would SBNC be interested in:
- Contributing student-specific policy documents you've identified
- Testing the library for navigator training
- Providing a letter of support

We could potentially support this collaboration with a small grant to SBNC or enhanced support for Navvy.

Best,
Max
