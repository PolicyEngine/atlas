Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - Collaboration Opportunity

Hi Cynthia and Abby,

Abby, thanks for joining those Policy Library planning meetings with Atlanta Fed and GCO! Your insights have been really valuable in shaping this project.

We're applying to PBIF for the PolicyEngine Policy Library we've been discussing - using AI to permanently archive and serve benefit policy documents. You can see our vision and mockup at policyengine.github.io/policy-library

Rather than navigate university subgrant complexity, we'd love to propose an in-kind collaboration that might be more valuable for both of us:

**What PN3 contributes:**
- Policy documents from your state tax credit research and other prenatal-to-3 programs
- Testing and feedback on the library's research utility
- Letter of collaboration for the PBIF application

**What PolicyEngine provides in exchange:**
- Priority support for encoding any new state tax credit rules you need for upcoming research
- Custom integration of the Policy Library into your research workflow
- API access tailored to your specific document needs
- Technical support for using PolicyEngine in your analyses

This approach avoids Vanderbilt's overhead while ensuring you get direct value from the collaboration. You're already using PolicyEngine for state tax credit modeling - this would deepen that partnership and ensure you always have access to the source documents underlying our parameters.

Current partners include Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Georgia Center for Opportunity, MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Georgetown, USC, and potentially Urban Institute and Aspen FSP.

Would this work for you? Letter would be due by Friday (apologies for short notice), but happy to draft something if that helps.

Best,
Max
