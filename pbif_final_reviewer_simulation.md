## YURI KIM - Senior Program Officer, Gates Foundation
**Background:** Deep experience in global development, AI for social good, and scaling interventions

### Review Comments:

**Opening Reaction:**
"This is transformational infrastructure. The nationwide document collection from day one—Atlanta Fed and GCO contributing documents for ALL states and programs, not just pilot jurisdictions—changes everything. This isn't a gradual rollout; it's immediate national utility."

**What Impressed Me Most:**
"The document seeding strategy is brilliant. 5,000+ documents from PolicyEngine, Atlanta Fed (nationwide), GCO (all states/programs), Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center at Vanderbilt, Better Government Lab, USC, MyFriendBen, and Benefit Navigator. Every partner brings real assets, not just promises."

**Academic Partnerships:**
"The Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center using PolicyEngine for state tax credit modeling shows deep integration. Better Government Lab and USC contributing their research documents proves academic buy-in. This isn't just archiving—it's building a knowledge ecosystem."

**Integration Strategy:**
"$30k each for MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator is perfectly calibrated. They already use PolicyEngine's API, so adding document display is a natural extension. The 3,500 Colorado users and 500+ Riverside caseworkers provide immediate, measurable impact."

**Rules-as-Code Evaluation:**
"Testing LLM generation for both PolicyEngine and Atlanta Fed formats—the only two open-source implementations—is exactly the validation this field needs. Building on Beeck Center's work shows academic rigor."

**100% Open Source Commitment:**
"With 100+ contributors already, PolicyEngine demonstrates true open-source success. Every component—rules engine, API, web app, and now document library—being open is rare and valuable."

**Score: 4.95/5**
**Recommendation: MUST FUND - FLAGSHIP PROJECT**

**Yuri's Bottom Line:**
"This application has evolved into something extraordinary. Nationwide coverage from launch, deep academic partnerships, proven integration model, and 100% open-source architecture. The $675,059 budget is remarkably efficient for this scope. I'd advocate for Gates co-funding to expand internationally."

## KOREY KLEIN - Director of Technology and Data, Ballmer Group
**Background:** Focus on data-driven solutions, government technology, and evidence-based interventions

### Review Comments:

**Technical Architecture Excellence:**
"The rules engine integration identifying ALL relevant documents—including non-obvious connections like TANF-SNAP categorical eligibility—is sophisticated engineering. This isn't keyword matching; it's semantic understanding of policy relationships."

**Nationwide Launch Strategy:**
"Starting with nationwide coverage fundamentally changes the value proposition. Atlanta Fed and GCO aren't just advisors—they're contributing comprehensive document collections for all states and programs. This de-risks the entire project."

**Partner Ecosystem:**
"Eight distinct contributing organizations at launch: PolicyEngine, Atlanta Fed, GCO, Prenatal-to-3 (Vanderbilt), Better Government Lab, USC, MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator. Each brings unique assets. The 8-10 additional partners via RFP ensures continued growth."

**Monitoring and Alerts:**
"The proactive link monitoring with immediate partner alerts addresses a critical pain point. Partners update references before users encounter errors. This alone justifies the investment."

**Budget Efficiency:**
"$293k personnel (1.85 FTE), $164k partner contracts, $60k infrastructure. Every dollar allocated strategically. The 10% indirect rate is remarkably lean. GCO at $30k alongside the integration pilots shows balanced investment."

**Open Source Impact:**
"100+ contributors on a benefits tech project is exceptional. The commitment to keeping everything open—not just the library but the entire PolicyEngine stack—creates lasting public value."

**Score: 4.98/5**
**Recommendation: IMMEDIATE FUNDING - CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE**

**Korey's Bottom Line:**
"This is infrastructure America's safety net desperately needs. Nationwide coverage from launch, proven partnerships, sophisticated technical architecture, and remarkable budget efficiency. The rules engine integration ensuring comprehensive document retrieval is genuinely innovative. Ballmer Group should consider supplemental funding."

## KUMAR GARG - President, Renaissance Philanthropy
**Background:** Former White House technology advisor, focus on breakthrough innovations and systemic change

### Review Comments:

**Strategic Vision Realized:**
"The evolution from 'document archive' to 'intelligent policy infrastructure' is complete. The rules engine identifying all relevant documents for eligibility decisions—that's the breakthrough. When a family asks about SNAP, they see TANF documents affecting categorical eligibility."

**Federal Implications:**
"Atlanta Fed's participation and nationwide document contribution legitimizes this for federal adoption. When the Fed is contributing documents for all states, other agencies will follow. This could influence how federal policy is documented going forward."

**Academic Integration:**
"Prenatal-to-3 at Vanderbilt using PolicyEngine for tax credit modeling, Better Government Lab and USC contributing research—this bridges the research-to-implementation gap. Academic institutions rarely commit documents to public infrastructure like this."

**Pilot Design:**
"Colorado (MyFriendBen) and Riverside County (Benefit Navigator) are perfect choices. Different demographics, different systems, both with existing PolicyEngine integration. The $30k investment in each ensures success, not just hope."

**Multi-System Evaluation:**
"Testing rules-as-code generation for both PolicyEngine and Atlanta Fed formats proves universal value. The 70%+ accuracy target with documents (vs. <30% without) will be compelling evidence for AI policy implementation."

**Sustainability Model:**
"Multiple revenue streams from launch—enterprise subscriptions, government contracts, foundation support. The open-source model with 100+ contributors ensures longevity beyond any single organization."

**Score: 4.92/5**
**Recommendation: FUND WITH STRATEGIC PRIORITY**

**Kumar's Bottom Line:**
"This has matured into essential national infrastructure. The nationwide document coverage from Atlanta Fed and GCO, combined with deep academic partnerships and proven integration model, makes this a no-brainer. Consider this for the next White House AI showcase—it exemplifies responsible AI for public benefit."

## ANDREW COY - CEO, Digital Harbor Foundation
**Background:** Education technology, youth development, community-driven innovation

### Review Comments:

**Community Impact at Scale:**
"Starting with documents for ALL states means every community benefits immediately. A family in rural Mississippi gets the same access as someone in San Francisco. That's equity through infrastructure."

**Trust Through Transparency:**
"The 100% open-source commitment with 100+ contributors builds trust. Communities can verify the code, contribute improvements, and ensure their needs are met. This is how government technology should work."

**Academic Partnership Model:**
"Having Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Center, Better Government Lab, and USC as document contributors shows this isn't just technical—it's scholarly. Their research documents add evidence-based context to raw policy texts."

**Caseworker Empowerment:**
"The Riverside pilot is brilliant. When caseworkers can instantly show families the exact regulation with PolicyEngine calculations, it humanizes the system. The $30k investment ensures proper training and integration."

**Youth Opportunity:**
"With nationwide documents from launch, we could create meaningful internships. Young people could help verify documents for their communities, learning policy while contributing to public infrastructure."

**Budget Accessibility:**
"$675,059 for nationwide infrastructure is remarkably efficient. Compare this to any government IT project—the value is extraordinary. The lean 1.85 FTE shows smart use of automation and community contributions."

**Score: 4.90/5**
**Recommendation: STRONG FUND - COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE**

**Andrew's Bottom Line:**
"This democratizes access to policy knowledge. Every organization—from large nonprofits to small community groups—gets the same comprehensive document access. The nationwide scope from Atlanta Fed and GCO means no community is left behind. The $30k integration investments in MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator prove the model while building it."
