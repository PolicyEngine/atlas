# PBIF-Aligned Executive Summary for Policy Library

## The Cross-Cutting Infrastructure Every PBIF Applicant Needs

### Direct Alignment with PBIF Priority Areas

The Policy Library addresses the root cause behind ALL four PBIF priority areas:

**1. Income and Employment Verification**
- Caseworkers can't find current income disregard policies → improper denials
- Our solution: Instant API access to state-specific verification rules with version history

**2. SNAP Error Rate Reduction**  
- Many errors stem from outdated or misunderstood policy documents
- Our solution: AI-monitored archives ensure staff always have current eligibility criteria

**3. Clear Beneficiary Communication**
- Advocates can't explain rules they can't find
- Our solution: Every rule linked to its authoritative source, enabling confident guidance

**4. Application/Verification/Appeal Backlog Reduction**
- Staff waste substantial time hunting for policy clarifications
- Our solution: Instant document access returns hours to actual casework

### Why This Is THE Upstream Solution

Every organization building tools for these priorities—including other PBIF applicants—faces the same infrastructure gap: 
- Government documents disappear constantly
- Agencies reorganize websites quarterly, breaking every integration
- Critical memos exist only in email chains or filing cabinets
- Staff confidence erodes when they can't verify their guidance

**We're not competing with other applicants—we're the infrastructure layer they all need.**

### Not Starting From Scratch: Production-Ready Partners

**Current Implementation Partners:**
- **Atlanta Fed Policy Rules Database**: Federal pilot complete, expanding to states
- **Georgia Center for Opportunity**: North Carolina pilot live with 1,000+ documents
- **MyFriendBen**: 3,500 monthly users gaining reliable document access
- **Benefit Navigator** (Nava/Gates): Testing API integration
- **PN3 Policy Impact Center**: Research validation partner

**Government Engagement:**
- Letter of support from Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (quasi-governmental)
- Active discussions with GA DHS through GCO partnership
- NC state agencies engaged via existing pilots

### Technical Feasibility: Already Proven

**Existing Assets:**
- Working prototypes at github.com/PolicyEngine/us-sources and us-nc-sources
- Interactive mockup demonstrating full system: https://policyengine.github.io/policy-library
- PolicyEngine's 2,500+ document references prove the need and approach
- AI crawlers tested successfully on state agency sites

**12-Month Production Timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Scale existing crawlers to 10 states
- Months 4-6: API v1 with partner integration
- Months 7-9: 30 states with weekly monitoring
- Months 10-12: Full production with 50+ jurisdictions

### Evaluation Criteria Alignment

**Impact**: Removes a critical infrastructure barrier for EVERY safety net tool
- Measurable: Partner time savings, document availability metrics, API usage
- Direct beneficiary impact through existing partner networks

**Responsible AI**: Documents are facts, not interpretations
- No bias risk: We preserve source material, not encode rules
- Full transparency: All documents publicly accessible
- Privacy protected: No beneficiary data ever collected

**Technical & Practical Feasibility**: 
- Integrates with ANY system via simple REST API
- Government partners actively engaged (Atlanta Fed, GCO)
- Team has 5+ years building PolicyEngine's document infrastructure

**Strategic Alignment**: Without this, every other tool remains fragile
- No other funder will support pure infrastructure
- Creates multiplier effect for entire ecosystem

**Shared Learning and Scale**: 
- Everything open source from day one
- API free tier for all nonprofits
- Documentation enables self-service adoption

### The Ask

$498,000 over 2 years to build the document infrastructure that every other PBIF project needs to succeed. This includes:

- $405,000: Engineering team (2.5 FTE)
- $60,000: Partner microgrants for document contribution and testing
- $18,000: Cloud infrastructure
- $15,000: Contingency

### Partner Microgrant Structure (Addressing GCO Concerns)

Given feedback from GCO as original pilot partner, consider tiered structure:

**Founding Partners** (GCO, Atlanta Fed): $20-30K
- Recognition of early risk and contribution
- Deeper integration support
- Co-authorship on impact studies

**Implementation Partners** (MyFriendBen, etc.): $10-15K
- Standard integration and testing
- Contribution of jurisdiction-specific documents

**Testing Partners**: $5-10K
- Light-touch integration
- Feedback and validation

This preserves most funds for core development while recognizing partner contributions appropriately.

### One-Line Pitch

We're building the document infrastructure that makes every other PBIF project actually work—because you can't reduce SNAP errors or verify income if the policy documents keep disappearing.
