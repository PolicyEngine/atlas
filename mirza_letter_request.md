Subject: Excited about our SNAP API partnership + PolicyEngine Policy Library opportunity

Hi Siran,

So excited that Mirza will be leveraging our SNAP API! Can't wait to see how you integrate accurate benefit calculations into your childcare subsidy platform - this is exactly the kind of real-world impact we built PolicyEngine for. The combination of childcare support and SNAP benefits navigation will be powerful for working families.

Wanted to share another project that might be valuable for Mirza: We're applying to PBIF for the PolicyEngine Policy Library - using AI to permanently archive and serve benefit policy documents across all programs and jurisdictions. You can see our vision and mockup at policyengine.github.io/policy-library

Given Mirza's focus on childcare subsidies, would you be interested in participating? You could:
- Contribute childcare subsidy documents you've collected (CCDF, state programs, etc.)
- Test the API to access comprehensive childcare policy docs for your platform
- Compare your collection with what partners like Atlanta Fed have already contributed

We'd provide a microgrant to support your integration and testing. Current partners include Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Georgia Center for Opportunity, NBER, Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center (Vanderbilt), MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Georgetown, USC, and potentially Urban Institute.

The library would ensure Mirza always has access to current childcare subsidy rules, implementation guidance, and eligibility criteria - never broken links or missing documents. Could be especially valuable as you scale to new states.

Interested? Happy to discuss details. Application is due Saturday but we can add partners after submission too.

Best,
Max
