Subject: Re: Proposal

Hi Alex,

Thank you so much for the quick legal review and the encouragement on the application! We've absolutely emphasized that no funds go to the Fed - it's mentioned multiple times throughout.

I realize Fed institutions may have constraints on formal letters, but wanted to check if any form of written acknowledgment of our collaboration might be possible - even just confirming the factual relationship described in the application. 

If that's not feasible within Fed policies, no worries at all - having your legal team's approval to include the collaboration in our application is already very valuable support.

We're submitting Saturday. Thanks again for navigating the internal process to make this collaboration possible!

Thanks again for all your support on this!

Best,
Max
