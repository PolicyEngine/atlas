# Urban Institute Letter of Support Request

## For: Greg Acs, Linda Giannarelli, and Sarah Minton (TRIM3 Team)

### Grant Description Paragraph

PolicyEngine is applying for a $675,059 grant from the Public Benefit Innovation Fund (PBIF), a groundbreaking initiative funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Ballmer Group, and Families and Workers Fund to accelerate AI-enabled technology that reduces administrative burden in America's safety net programs. Our project, the PolicyEngine Policy Library, will create a permanently archived, AI-powered collection of policy documents (statutes, regulations, implementation memos, and forms) for safety net programs across all 50+ U.S. jurisdictions. Using Claude and GPT-5 to intelligently monitor and extract documents from government websites weekly, the library will prevent the critical problem of disappearing policy documentsâ€”where broken links and website reorganizations cause essential program information to vanish, disrupting benefits access tools nationwide. The system will provide stable APIs ensuring that caseworkers, researchers, benefits navigators, and AI tools always have access to current, authoritative documents for SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and other critical programs.

### Urban Institute's Potential Involvement

The Urban Institute is supportive of engaging in the development of the PolicyEngine Policy Library project. Should the grant be awarded, we would explore opportunities for collaboration, which may include Urban contributing policy documents from TRIM3 and other Urban research projects to seed the library, testing the platform to ensure it meets researcher needs, and potentially entering into a subgrant arrangement to formalize these contributions. Urban's extensive expertise in microsimulation modeling and safety net program analysis would provide valuable validation and feedback during the library's development, ensuring the tool serves the research community effectively.

### Next Steps

If this language works for your letter, please feel free to modify as needed for your institutional requirements. We're excited about the potential collaboration and the opportunity to preserve Urban's valuable policy research alongside our other partners including the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Georgia Center for Opportunity, and leading direct service organizations like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator.

## Email Draft to Send

Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - Letter of Support Request

Dear Greg, Linda, and Sarah,

Thank you so much for taking the time to meet today and for your willingness to provide a letter of support for our PBIF application. As discussed, I've drafted the requested paragraph describing the grant and a suggested statement about Urban's potential involvement.

[Insert paragraphs above]

Please feel free to adjust this language to align with Urban's institutional voice and any internal requirements. If you need any additional information or have questions about the project, I'm happy to provide more details.

The letter of support would be most helpful if it could be on Urban Institute letterhead and signed by an appropriate authority. We're working toward the August 16, 2025 deadline, so having the letter by early August would be ideal.

Thank you again for your support and for considering this collaboration. The TRIM3 team's expertise would be invaluable in making this infrastructure truly useful for the research community.

Best regards,
Max Ghenis
