**Subject:** PolicyEngine PBIF Application - Atlanta Fed Collaboration Summary

Hi Alex,

I wanted to share our PBIF application draft and clarify the Atlanta Fed's proposed involvement, ensuring we're accurately representing our collaboration.

**Application Materials:**
- Full application: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hUQOhh1YVdwHReQx7LBRpYL8QTe9K37iM6J1sQNGncw/edit?tab=t.0
- Budget details: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJdmn3IF09h0YA7hYeem80CCfDc1z8jYdeCkq5Phknw

**How we've described Atlanta Fed's involvement:**

1. **Three-way pilot collaboration** with PolicyEngine and Georgia Center for Opportunity, contributing documents for all states and programs nationwide (not limited to federal/NC)

2. **Document contribution** - We describe the Fed as contributing documents compatible with the Policy Rules Database format, helping seed our system with 5,000+ documents at launch

3. **Rules-as-code evaluation participation** - We propose testing how well LLMs can generate entries for the open-source Policy Rules Database format (alongside PolicyEngine's format), demonstrating the document library's value for automated policy implementation

4. **No financial commitment** - We understand the Fed cannot accept funds, so there's no budget allocation to Atlanta Fed

5. **No formal deliverable commitments** - We've avoided language suggesting the Fed would produce joint reports or specific analyses

**What we've been careful about:**
- Not overstating the Fed's commitment level
- Describing it as "collaboration" rather than formal partnership
- Focusing on the mutual benefit of document preservation infrastructure
- Emphasizing the open-source, public good nature of the project

Would you be able to review the application (particularly pages mentioning Atlanta Fed) to ensure we're representing your involvement appropriately? We want to make sure we're accurate about the collaboration while respecting any constraints on what the Fed can formally commit to.

The PBIF deadline is August 16, so any feedback by early next week would be greatly appreciated. Happy to adjust any language to better reflect the actual scope of collaboration.

Thanks for your continued support of this important infrastructure project.

Best,
Max
