# Letter of Collaboration Request - Georgetown BGL & USC

## Email to Eric Giannella (Georgetown BGL) and Matt Unrath (USC)

Subject: Re: 2018 data and collaboration + PBIF Letter Request

Hi Eric and Matt,

Thanks for confirming the 2018 rules encoding plan! The six-month timeline works well, and we'll definitely leverage the LLM-based policy coding tool to help your RAs. The parallelization approach Chloe suggested is smart.

Quick request with apologies for the short notice (due Saturday): We're applying for a Public Benefit Innovation Fund (PBIF) grant for our PolicyEngine Policy Library project - an AI-powered permanent archive of policy documents. You can see our draft application at policyengine.github.io/policy-library.

Beyond the rules-as-code applications we've discussed, we think the Policy Library could have broader academic value - providing context for LLMs analyzing policy impacts, enabling historical policy evolution studies, documenting implementation variations across states, etc. We'd love your thoughts on other research applications we might not have considered.

Given our collaboration on encoding historical rules, would you be willing to provide brief letters of collaboration? The letters would acknowledge our existing partnership (where you're funding PolicyEngine to add historical parameters) and note interest in testing/contributing to the Policy Library. For this grant, we're focusing budget on direct service organizations that need resources for integration, while academic partners would collaborate through research contributions and testing.

I've drafted sample language below the fold that you could adapt. Letters would ideally be on institutional letterhead and signed by someone with signature authority.

Would this be possible by Friday? Again, apologies for the short timeline!

Best,
Max

## DRAFT LETTER - Georgetown Better Government Lab

[On Georgetown University Letterhead]

**Letter of Collaboration for PolicyEngine Policy Library**

To Whom It May Concern:

The Better Government Lab at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy is pleased to collaborate on the PolicyEngine Policy Library project, an initiative to create a permanently archived collection of safety net policy documents.

Our lab is currently contracting with PolicyEngine to encode historical benefit program rules for 2018 and adjacent years, demonstrating our commitment to building robust policy infrastructure for research. As part of this collaboration, we will:

- Contribute policy documents from our research on SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, TANF, and other safety net programs to help seed the Policy Library
- Test the Policy Library platform to ensure it meets academic research needs
- Provide feedback on document organization and metadata standards based on our extensive work with administrative data

The Policy Library addresses critical challenges our researchers face: policy documents frequently disappear from government websites, making it impossible to conduct longitudinal analysis or verify historical eligibility rules. Beyond supporting rules-as-code development, this infrastructure will enable new research methodologies including: providing authoritative context for LLMs analyzing policy impacts, documenting implementation variations across jurisdictions, tracking policy evolution over time, and preserving implementation memos that reveal administrative intent. This infrastructure will be invaluable for our work measuring participation gaps and analyzing policy impacts.

We look forward to this collaboration and believe the Policy Library will become essential infrastructure for the safety net research community.

Sincerely,

## DRAFT LETTER - USC

[On USC Letterhead]

**Letter of Collaboration for PolicyEngine Policy Library**

To Whom It May Concern:

The University of Southern California is pleased to collaborate on the PolicyEngine Policy Library project, an initiative to create a permanently archived collection of safety net policy documents.

USC is currently contracting with PolicyEngine to model effective tax rates across multiple benefit programs including SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, WIC, SSI, and housing assistance for historical years. This existing partnership demonstrates our investment in comprehensive policy modeling infrastructure. As part of the Policy Library collaboration, we will:

- Contribute policy documents from our research archives to help seed the library
- Test the platform for academic use cases, particularly multi-program interaction analysis
- Provide feedback to ensure the library serves researchers studying participation gaps and benefit cliffs

The Policy Library solves persistent problems in our research: the disappearance of historical policy documents essential for understanding program evolution, and the lack of structured context for AI-assisted policy analysis. Beyond our immediate needs for rules encoding, permanent access to these documents will enable new research approaches: using LLMs with authoritative policy context to analyze participation gaps, documenting state-level implementation differences, studying how policies evolve in response to economic conditions, and preserving the full context of policy intent through implementation guidance. This will significantly enhance our ability to study safety net program effectiveness and multi-program interactions.

We support this important infrastructure project and look forward to collaborating on its development.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
Matthew Unrath, Ph.D.

## Note
Feel free to modify this language as needed for your institutional requirements. The key points are:
1. You're already investing in PolicyEngine to build historical rules (shows commitment)
2. You'll contribute documents and test the platform
3. The Policy Library solves real problems you face in your research
4. This collaboration focuses on research partnership rather than subgrants
