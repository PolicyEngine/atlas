# PBIF Application Emails

## Email 1: To Korey Klein

Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - PBIF Application

Hi Korey,

Thank you for the heads up about PBIF and encouraging us to apply when we met earlier this year. We're submitting an application for the Policy Library - infrastructure to permanently archive and serve the policy documents that define benefit eligibility.

The core challenge: Every organization building benefit tools spends substantial time hunting for the same policy documents. We're all calling agencies, filing FOIAs, and maintaining separate PDF collections. PolicyEngine alone references 2,500+ unique policy documents in our rules-as-code (nearly 4,000 citations including page-specific references) that are vulnerable to link rot.

Our solution is shared infrastructure: AI-powered crawlers to find documents (including those not available online), permanent archives with version control, and simple APIs for access. We're already piloting with the Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database, Georgia Center for Opportunity, and MyFriendBen.

We've built a mockup at https://policyengine.github.io/policy-library that demonstrates the document submission flow, retrieval interface, API access, and MCP server integration for AI assistants.

If you have 15-20 minutes this week for a quick call about the application, that would be incredibly valuable given Saturday's deadline. Otherwise, any feedback you could share would be greatly appreciated.

Best,
Max

## Email 2: To Yuri Kim

Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library PBIF Application + Catching Up on Benefit Access

Hi Yuri,

I hope you're doing well. We're applying to PBIF for the Policy Library - the document infrastructure component that addresses challenges we've discussed in our previous conversations about benefit access.

The fundamental problem: Organizations building benefit tools all duplicate the same painstaking document research. PolicyEngine references 2,500+ unique policy documents in our code (with nearly 4,000 page-specific citations to IRS publications, CFRs, and state regulations) - all vulnerable to disappearing. We're building shared infrastructure to find, permanently archive, and serve these documents to the entire ecosystem.

Our mockup at https://policyengine.github.io/policy-library demonstrates the complete system: document submission workflows, search and retrieval interface, API access, and MCP server integration for AI assistants.

We're already piloting with the Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database, MyFriendBen, and Georgia Center for Opportunity. This infrastructure would support all the benefit access initiatives we've discussed.

I would very much appreciate the opportunity to catch up this week - both to get your input on the PBIF application (due Saturday) and to discuss the broader benefit access landscape. If you have 15-20 minutes available, that would be wonderful, though I'm happy to find more time if your schedule permits. And if this week doesn't work, I'd still value catching up more broadly on benefit access work sometime soon.

Best,
Max

Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - PBIF Application

Dear PBIF Team,

We are submitting an application for the PolicyEngine Policy Library, infrastructure to permanently preserve and serve the documents that define safety net program eligibility.

**The Problem:** Organizations building benefit access tools face a fundamental infrastructure challenge: the documents defining eligibility rules are scattered across hundreds of agency websites, buried in PDFs, hidden behind paywalls, or not available online. Every organization duplicates the same painstaking research - calling agencies, filing FOIAs, maintaining separate document collections. Meanwhile, families cannot access benefits because the rules are too difficult to find and understand. PolicyEngine's own benefit calculator references 2,500+ unique policy documents (with nearly 4,000 page-specific citations) that remain vulnerable to link rot.

**Our Solution:** We are building shared infrastructure with AI-powered crawlers to systematically find policy documents (including those not available online), permanent archives with version control, and simple APIs for universal access. This creates a true public good for policy knowledge that accelerates the entire benefit access ecosystem.

**Current Progress:** We are already piloting with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Policy Rules Database, Georgia Center for Opportunity, and MyFriendBen. Our interactive mockup at https://policyengine.github.io/policy-library demonstrates the complete system including document submission workflows, search and retrieval interface, API access, and MCP server integration for AI assistants.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback before Saturday's deadline on how to strengthen our application to better serve PBIF's mission of reducing administrative burden through AI-enabled technology.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Max Ghenis
CEO, PolicyEngine

## Email 4: To Tara Watson

Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - Partnership Invitation for PBIF Application

Hi Tara,

I hope you're doing well. We're applying to PBIF for the PolicyEngine Policy Library, and I wanted to reach out given your work on Brookings' State Safety Net Interactive and the challenges we both face in encoding programs like TANF.

The core problem we're solving: Every organization encoding benefit rules deals with the same document nightmare - scattered sources, disappearing URLs, and duplicated research efforts. Your team knows this firsthand from building the State Safety Net Interactive. We're creating shared infrastructure to permanently archive and serve all the policy documents that define eligibility.

Our approach: AI-powered crawlers to systematically find documents (including those offline), permanent archives with version control, and simple APIs. We've built a mockup at https://policyengine.github.io/policy-library demonstrating the complete system.

We're including subgrants in our PBIF application for organizations like Brookings to:
- Contribute document collections and identify priority sources
- Test our approach with real use cases from your TANF work  
- Integrate the infrastructure into existing workflows

Would you be interested in being part of this project? Your expertise in state program variations would be invaluable in shaping what we build. The infrastructure would ensure that tools like the State Safety Net Interactive never lose source documents and can easily verify their encoded rules against authoritative sources.

If you have time for a brief call this week about the application (due Saturday) or next week about partnership more broadly, I'd very much appreciate your input.

Best,
Max

## Email 5: To Linda Giannarelli

Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - Grant Application & TRIM3 Synergies

Hi Linda,

I hope you're doing well. We're applying to the Public Benefit Innovation Fund (PBIF) - a new philanthropic initiative focused on AI-enabled technology for safety net programs. The grant just opened recently with an application due Saturday, and I wanted to reach out given Urban's extensive work with TRIM3 and the document challenges inherent in microsimulation modeling.

The problem we're addressing resonates deeply with TRIM3's needs: policy documents that define program rules are scattered, frequently disappear, and require enormous effort to track down. Every microsimulation project faces this same infrastructure gap. We're building a permanent archive of all policy documents with AI-powered discovery and simple API access.

Our mockup at https://policyengine.github.io/policy-library shows the complete system including document submission, retrieval, and API integration.

Given TRIM3's decades of encoding federal and state policies, your team's expertise would be invaluable in:
- Identifying the most critical but hard-to-find documents
- Validating our approach for historical policy research
- Ensuring compatibility with microsimulation workflows

We're including subgrants in our PBIF application for organizations to contribute documents, test the infrastructure, and integrate it into their modeling work. This could significantly reduce the document management burden for TRIM3 while ensuring your source documents are permanently preserved and accessible.

Would you be interested in discussing potential collaboration? Even a brief conversation about your document pain points would strengthen our application (due Saturday) and help ensure we build something truly useful for the microsimulation community.

Best,
Max

## Email 6: To Dan Beeby

Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - Document Infrastructure Initiative

Hi Dan,

I hope you're doing well. We're applying to PBIF for the PolicyEngine Policy Library, and with the Saturday deadline approaching, I wanted to reach out.

We're proposing infrastructure that I believe could benefit everyone in our space: permanent archiving of the policy documents we all rely on. As you know from BenefitKitchen's work, finding and maintaining access to authoritative sources is a constant challenge - documents disappear, links break, and we all duplicate the same research.

Our approach focuses purely on the document layer: AI-powered discovery, permanent archives, and open access. We've built a mockup at https://policyengine.github.io/policy-library showing the system. The Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database, Georgia Center for Opportunity, and MyFriendBen are already on board as partners.

We're including subgrants in our PBIF application for organizations to contribute documents and test the infrastructure. Regardless of formal partnership, I'd value your perspective on what documents are hardest to maintain access to - that insight would strengthen the application and help ensure we build something genuinely useful for the ecosystem.

Would you be open to a brief conversation this week? Happy to keep it focused on the document infrastructure challenges we all face.

Best,
Max
