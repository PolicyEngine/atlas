# Section 1

## Executive Summary

PolicyEngine seeks $498,000 to build the Policy Library, an AI-powered infrastructure creating permanent, machine-readable archives of safety net program rules across all U.S. jurisdictions. Our solution addresses the critical problem of disappearing policy documents—18% of benefit program URLs from 2019 are now dead, causing families to lose benefits and organizations to waste thousands of hours maintaining broken systems.

Using Claude and GPT-4 powered crawlers, we monitor 50+ jurisdictions weekly, capturing statutes, regulations, and forms before they vanish. Human reviewers verify accuracy through GitHub pull requests, ensuring reliability. We serve everything through a stable API with permanent source IDs that never break, replacing the fragile direct links that current tools depend on.

The Policy Library will directly benefit three groups: families accessing benefits (reaching 160,000+ annually through partner tools), direct service organizations like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator (saving 10,000+ hours yearly on maintenance), and AI developers building benefit tools (providing authoritative sources to prevent hallucination).

Our pilot with North Carolina and the Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database proves the concept. With PolicyEngine's existing infrastructure serving 72,000 households annually, we're positioned to scale rapidly. Year one will archive 100,000+ documents across all states, integrate with major benefit access tools, and establish the national standard for policy preservation.

This investment will create lasting infrastructure that makes America's safety net more accessible, accurate, and equitable, while advancing the frontier of AI-powered government services through reliable, permanent source documentation.

# Section 2

## Problem Statement

America's safety net suffers from a critical infrastructure failure: policy documents that determine benefit eligibility disappear constantly. Our analysis reveals that 18% of benefit program URLs from 2019 are completely dead today. When CaseText shut down, thousands of legal references vanished overnight. State agencies regularly reorganize websites, breaking every link that benefit calculators, case workers, and families depend on.

This creates cascading failures throughout the benefits ecosystem. Families cannot verify their eligibility when documentation disappears, leading to wrongful denials and lost benefits. Case workers at organizations like MyFriendBen waste over 40 hours monthly updating broken links instead of helping clients. AI tools like ChatGPT provide dangerously incorrect benefit information without access to authoritative sources, potentially costing families thousands in unclaimed benefits.

The root cause is architectural: no standardized system exists for preserving policy documents. Agencies lack resources for permanent archives. Commercial providers can disappear without warning. No version control tracks policy changes over time. Current solutions are band-aids—each organization maintains partial, duplicative collections that quickly become outdated.

The human cost is staggering. Georgetown University researchers found that historical policy analysis is nearly impossible due to missing documents. The Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database struggles to maintain accuracy without reliable sources. Most critically, vulnerable families lose access to food, healthcare, and housing assistance because the rules governing these programs have literally disappeared from the internet, creating an invisible barrier to the benefits they desperately need and legally deserve.
