# Section 1

## Executive Summary

PolicyEngine proposes to build the Policy Library, an AI-powered infrastructure creating permanent, machine-readable archives of safety net program rules across federal, state, and DC jurisdictions. Our solution addresses the critical problem of disappearing policy documents that cause families to lose benefits and organizations to waste thousands of hours maintaining broken systems when links break and documents vanish.

We monitor agency websites across 50+ jurisdictions weekly, capturing statutes, regulations, and forms before they vanish, then use Claude and GPT-4 to analyze changes and measure document clarity. Human reviewers verify accuracy through GitHub pull requests, ensuring reliability. We serve everything through a stable API with permanent source IDs that never break, replacing fragile direct links.

The Policy Library will directly benefit three groups: families accessing benefits (reaching tens of thousands annually through partner tools), direct service organizations like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator (saving thousands of hours yearly on maintenance), and AI developers building benefit tools (providing authoritative sources to prevent hallucination).

Our pilot with North Carolina and the Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database proves the concept. With PolicyEngine's existing infrastructure serving 72,000 households annually, we're positioned to scale. Year one will archive thousands of documents across all states, integrate with major benefit access tools, establish the national standard for policy preservation, and launch our Clarity Index to reduce errors by improving document clarity.

This investment will create lasting infrastructure that makes America's safety net more accessible, accurate, and equitable, while advancing the frontier of AI-powered government services through reliable, permanent source documentation.

# Section 2

## Problem Statement

America's safety net suffers from a critical infrastructure failure: policy documents that determine benefit eligibility disappear constantly. Many benefit program URLs from just a few years ago are now completely dead. When CaseText shut down, thousands of legal references vanished overnight. State agencies regularly reorganize websites, breaking every link that benefit calculators, case workers, and families depend on.

This creates cascading failures throughout the benefits ecosystem. Families cannot verify their eligibility when documentation disappears, leading to wrongful denials and lost benefits. Case workers at organizations like MyFriendBen waste over 40 hours monthly updating broken links instead of helping clients. AI tools like ChatGPT provide dangerously incorrect benefit information without access to authoritative sources, potentially costing families thousands in unclaimed benefits.

The root cause is architectural: no standardized system exists for preserving policy documents. Agencies lack resources for permanent archives. Commercial providers can disappear without warning. No version control tracks policy changes over time. Current solutions are band-aids—each organization maintains partial, duplicative collections that quickly become outdated.

The human cost is staggering. Georgetown University researchers found that historical policy analysis is nearly impossible due to missing documents. The Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database struggles to maintain accuracy without reliable sources. Most critically, vulnerable families lose access to food, healthcare, and housing assistance because the rules governing these programs have literally disappeared from the internet, creating an invisible barrier to the benefits they desperately need and legally deserve.

## Solution & Target Beneficiaries

The Policy Library creates permanent, AI-powered archives of safety net program documents across federal, state, and DC jurisdictions, replacing fragile direct links with stable API endpoints that never break. Our solution employs Claude and GPT-4 crawlers to monitor agency websites weekly, capturing documents before they disappear, while human reviewers verify accuracy through GitHub workflows ensuring reliability and transparency.

Our primary beneficiaries span multiple stakeholder groups, starting with tens of thousands of families annually who will access benefits more reliably through our partner tools. When policy documents remain permanently available, families can verify their eligibility, appeal wrongful denials, and understand their rights without encountering the broken links that currently prevent them from accessing critical information. Our LLM benchmark demonstrates substantial accuracy improvement in benefit calculations when AI tools have access to these authoritative sources.

Direct service organizations including MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, SnapScreener, and hundreds of nonprofits will collectively save thousands of hours yearly that they currently waste on system maintenance. These organizations report spending substantial time monthly just updating broken links, time that could be spent serving clients. Our stable API eliminates this burden entirely, allowing them to focus on their core mission of helping families navigate the benefits system.

The research and AI community gains reliable training data enabling accurate benefit tools. Our unique PolicyEngine rules engine integration creates a knowledge graph revealing hidden connections—like SNAP's 200% FPL in NC enabling Lifeline. This helps families discover benefits through categorical eligibility pathways that document search alone never reveals.

## Proposed Benefit and Impact Evaluation

Our evaluation strategy combines quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and independent validation to measure impact across three critical dimensions of document preservation, user outcomes, and system improvements. We will track progress from a baseline of 500 documents to 50,000 in Year 1 and 100,000 by Year 2, while monitoring API usage patterns that we expect to reach one million calls monthly by grant end.

Partner integration growth from our current three organizations to dozens by Year 2 will demonstrate ecosystem adoption, while the number of people served through these partner tools will expand to tens of thousands annually. Through systematic partner surveys, we will document the thousands of hours saved annually by organizations no longer maintaining broken links, and our standardized benchmark will validate substantial improvement in LLM accuracy when AI tools access our authoritative sources.

Qualitative assessment through quarterly partner interviews captures workflow improvements and user stories. We'll develop case studies of families discovering categorical eligibility through rules engine connections—like NC households accessing Lifeline through SNAP's 200% FPL threshold. Developer feedback on our knowledge graph API, revealing hidden program interactions impossible to find through document search alone, guides continuous improvement.

Independent evaluation provides crucial third-party validation, with Georgetown University conducting our Year 2 impact assessment, Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Center evaluating child welfare improvements, and Urban Institute analyzing cost-effectiveness versus current approaches. Through difference-in-differences analysis comparing states with full versus partial coverage, we will rigorously isolate the Policy Library's contribution to improved benefit access outcomes.

## Responsible Design and Use

The Policy Library implements comprehensive safeguards ensuring ethical, secure, and equitable access to public benefit documentation while protecting privacy and preventing misuse.

Privacy protection begins with archiving only publicly available government documents, never collecting personal data. System architecture actively prevents PII storage even if accidentally encountered. We maintain no user tracking beyond basic API metrics, ensuring complete privacy while complying with GDPR, CCPA, and government standards through regular security audits.

Equity considerations shape every design decision. Comprehensive coverage of all states prevents geographic bias. Spanish language support in Year 2 addresses linguistic barriers. Free API access for nonprofits ensures cost never prevents usage. Simplified interfaces accommodate limited technical expertise. Community partnerships ensure diverse perspectives guide development.

AI safety protocols require human review before any document publication. Clear source labeling and extraction dates provide transparency. Version control maintains complete audit trails. Open source code enables community verification and corrections. Regular benchmarking against manual verification ensures sustained accuracy.

Misuse prevention balances openness with security. Rate limiting prevents abuse without impeding legitimate use. Terms explicitly prohibit fraud or harassment. Since documents are already public, we improve legitimate access without enabling new risks. Continuous monitoring identifies suspicious patterns while maintaining agency communication channels.

Transparency mechanisms ensure accountability through our public GitHub repository, monthly performance reports, community advisory board including affected populations, clear feedback channels for corrections, and regular third-party audits validating our practices meet highest ethical standards.

# Section 3

## Solution Description

The Policy Library solves the infrastructure problem of disappearing policy documents. Our architecture monitors jurisdiction websites weekly for statutes, regulations, memos, and forms. When changes are detected, Claude and GPT-4 analyze documents. Our open-source Clarity Index, trained on expert-flagged examples, measures how consistently AIs translate policy to code—mirroring caseworker interpretation. This identifies ambiguity driving SNAP QC errors.

Once identified, we capture documents using multiple preservation methods. PDFs and text documents go into Git repositories with Large File Storage, creating immutable version history. Dynamic web content uses Browsertrix for WARC-format archives preserving the complete browsing experience. Our bounty program incentivizes experts from Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity to vet AI contributions and submit documents, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

The technical infrastructure leverages proven, scalable technologies. Git provides distributed version control that prevents single points of failure. OpenSearch enables full-text search across millions of documents. Our RESTful API serves documents through permanent source IDs that never change, even when government websites reorganize. This combination of AI intelligence, human verification, and robust infrastructure creates a system that is both highly automated and exceptionally reliable.

Integration with PolicyEngine's rules engine creates unprecedented search. When users query "Lifeline eligibility," we trace encoded rules revealing NC's 200% FPL SNAP creates categorical eligibility for Lifeline. This knowledge graph, impossible with RAG alone, helps caseworkers understand program interactions and families discover hidden eligibility pathways.

## Data Strategy - Data Sources

Our data sources encompass every publicly available policy document governing safety net programs across federal, state, and local jurisdictions. We systematically collect statutes from legislative websites, regulations from agency portals, implementation memos from departmental archives, and application forms from program websites. Each jurisdiction maintains these documents differently, requiring our AI crawlers to adapt to hundreds of unique website structures and document formats.

The federal layer includes documents from CMS for Medicaid, USDA for SNAP, HHS for TANF, SSA for disability programs, and Treasury for tax credits. State sources span welfare departments, health agencies, workforce development boards, and housing authorities across all 50 states plus DC and territories. Local sources focus on major metropolitan areas with unique benefit programs, particularly counties administering General Assistance or emergency aid programs.

Our collection methodology employs multiple approaches to ensure comprehensiveness. AI-powered crawlers using Claude and GPT-4 perform intelligent extraction, understanding context to identify relevant documents while filtering out irrelevant content. Partner contributions from organizations like NBER, Urban Institute, and Georgetown provide specialized collections we might otherwise miss. Community submissions through GitHub allow corrections and additions from users who discover documents our automated systems haven't found.

Data quality assurance happens at multiple levels. Initial AI extraction undergoes human review for accuracy. Documents are checksummed to detect modifications. Metadata includes source URL, extraction date, and verification status. Version control tracks all changes over time. This multi-layered approach ensures that every document in our system is authentic, current, and properly attributed to its authoritative source.

## Data Strategy - Data Management

Our data management strategy ensures document integrity, accessibility, and preservation through multiple layers of governance and quality control. Every document entering our system undergoes verification through a transparent GitHub-based review process where human reviewers confirm accuracy of AI extraction, validate document authenticity, and ensure proper metadata attribution. This open review process creates accountability while enabling community contributions and corrections.

Version control forms the foundation of our preservation strategy. Using Git with Large File Storage, we maintain complete history of every document change, enabling researchers to access any historical version and track policy evolution over time. Documents are cryptographically hashed to detect any modifications, and our distributed architecture across multiple Git remotes prevents single points of failure. Regular backups to cold storage ensure documents remain available even in catastrophic scenarios.

Data quality metrics guide our continuous improvement process. We track extraction accuracy rates, measuring how often human reviewers must correct AI-identified documents. Response time metrics ensure our API meets performance requirements for production systems. Coverage analysis identifies gaps in our collection, prioritizing jurisdictions or document types needing attention. User feedback loops enable rapid correction of any errors that reach production.

Access control balances openness with security. Read access remains open through our public API, supporting our mission of democratizing policy information. Write access requires authentication and follows strict contribution guidelines. Rate limiting prevents abuse while ensuring legitimate users have reliable access. Usage analytics help us understand access patterns without collecting personally identifiable information about users, maintaining privacy while improving service delivery.

Our stakeholder engagement strategy builds on strong existing partnerships while systematically expanding to serve the entire benefits ecosystem. We secured letters of support from leading research institutions including Georgetown's Better Government Lab, Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Urban Institute, each committing to contribute specialized document collections and validate our approach. Direct service organizations like Benefit Kitchen, MyFriendBen, and SnapScreener confirmed the critical need for this infrastructure and committed to early adoption.

Engagement happens through multiple channels tailored to each stakeholder group. Our bounty program incentivizes experts from trusted organizations like Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity to vet AI contributions and submit their own documents, ensuring comprehensive coverage across the rules-as-code ecosystem. Direct service organizations participate in monthly user groups sharing implementation challenges. Government partners like the Atlanta Federal Reserve integrate our system into their Policy Rules Database. Community advocates contribute through our open GitHub process, ensuring affected populations have direct input.

## Resources and Infrastructure

The Policy Library leverages modern cloud infrastructure designed for scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency. Our technical stack combines proven technologies that handle millions of documents while minimizing operational complexity. Cloud hosting through AWS or Google Cloud provides auto-scaling compute resources that expand during crawling operations and contract during quiet periods, optimizing costs while ensuring performance.

Storage architecture employs a tiered approach matching access patterns to appropriate technologies. Hot storage using Git with Large File Storage maintains frequently accessed current documents with instant retrieval. Warm storage in object stores like S3 holds historical versions and less-accessed documents at lower cost. Cold storage archives ensure permanent preservation of all documents even if primary systems fail. This tiered approach reduces costs while maintaining rapid access to the documents users need most.

Our API uniquely combines document search with PolicyEngine's rules engine metadata. When searching "Lifeline eligibility," we trace encoded rules revealing NC's 200% FPL SNAP creates categorical eligibility. This knowledge graph surfaces hidden program connections impossible to find through traditional search or RAG alone, helping families discover unknown benefit eligibility.

Development infrastructure supports rapid iteration while maintaining quality. Continuous integration pipelines automatically test code changes, ensuring new features don't break existing functionality. Staging environments enable partner testing before production deployment. Monitoring systems track performance metrics, alert on anomalies, and provide insights for optimization. This robust infrastructure foundation enables us to serve hundreds of partner organizations reliably while keeping operational costs manageable.

## Scalability & Sustainability

Our sustainability model transitions from grant funding to self-sufficiency through diversified revenue streams that align incentives with our public benefit mission. During the grant period, we establish the foundation for long-term viability by demonstrating clear value to multiple stakeholder groups who will sustain the system through various contribution models.

Revenue diversification ensures no single funding source controls the project's future. Premium API tiers for high-volume commercial users generate recurring revenue while keeping basic access free for nonprofits. Enterprise contracts with large organizations needing custom integrations or guaranteed support levels provide predictable income. Government contracts for specialized document collections or enhanced services leverage our expertise while serving public needs. Foundation grants for specific enhancements or expansions supplement earned revenue without creating dependency.

Cost structure improvements over time enhance sustainability. Initial AI training costs decrease as models learn document patterns, reducing per-document processing expenses. Community contributions of corrections and additions lower content acquisition costs. Automated quality checks reduce human review requirements. Economies of scale mean that doubling our document count increases costs by only thirty percent, creating improving unit economics as we grow.

Scalability mechanisms ensure growth doesn't compromise quality or accessibility. Technical architecture using serverless functions and object storage scales automatically. Content contribution protocols enable distributed collection without bottlenecks. Partnership models create self-reinforcing growth where each user organization attracts others. Geographic expansion templates allow replication in new countries with minimal investment. This combination of diversified revenue, improving economics, and scalability ensures the Policy Library becomes permanent infrastructure for equitable benefit access.

## Financial Viability

Financial viability beyond the grant period relies on proven revenue models already validated in similar contexts. Our analysis of comparable infrastructure projects shows that organizations serving policy data typically achieve break-even within 18 months of launch through a combination of subscription revenue and service contracts.

Our revenue projections build on conservative assumptions grounded in current market dynamics. With 30 partner organizations by Year 2, premium tier subscriptions at $500 monthly average generate $180,000 annually. Enterprise contracts with five large organizations at $50,000 each provide $250,000 yearly. Government contracts for specialized collections contribute another $200,000. This creates $630,000 annual revenue by grant end, covering operational costs while enabling continued growth.

Cost optimization strategies ensure financial efficiency without compromising quality. Cloud infrastructure costs decrease through reserved instance pricing. Automation reduces manual processing from 80 percent of documents in Year 1 to 20 percent by Year 2. Our bounty program incentivizes contributions from Urban Institute, Georgia Center for Opportunity, and other trusted organizations, building community ownership. Strategic partnerships share infrastructure costs.

Financial controls and governance ensure responsible stewardship. Monthly financial reviews track revenue against projections and identify variances early. Diversified revenue streams prevent over-dependence on any single source. Reserve funds equivalent to six months operating expenses provide cushion for unexpected changes. Board oversight including financial experts ensures strategic financial management. Transparent reporting to stakeholders maintains trust and accountability. This comprehensive financial strategy ensures the Policy Library becomes self-sustaining infrastructure that continues serving vulnerable populations long after initial grant funding ends.
