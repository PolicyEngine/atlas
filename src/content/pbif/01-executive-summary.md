The Policy Library creates infrastructure transforming benefits delivery. When tools access comprehensive source documents, we enable: AI accurately determining multi-program eligibility, caseworkers confidently navigating rules, researchers tracking policy variations, and innovations we haven't imagined.

We combine AI-powered monitoring (Claude/GPT-5) with PolicyEngine's open-source rules engine. We understand document relationships, surface non-obvious connections (TANF-SNAP categorical eligibility), enabling tools to build on authoritative ground truth.

**PBIF Priority Impact:** Income verification via state-specific disregards; reduced SNAP errors through current criteria; confident beneficiary communication with source documents; backlog reduction saving staff time.

**Not starting from scratch:** Collaboration with Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Georgia Center for Opportunity, NBER, Prenatal-to-3, Better Government Lab, USC, MyFriendBen, and Benefit Navigator continues—we seed the library with documents covering nationwide scope. NBER and Prenatal-to-3 already use PolicyEngine for tax credit modeling; Mirza and Impactica use our API. We'll add document display to existing API requests and integrate into caseworker training. Colorado users and Riverside County caseworkers see primary sources alongside calculations.

**12-month timeline:** Months 1-3: Launch 5,000+ documents, 10 states; Months 4-6: API v1 with partners; Months 7-9: 30 states; Months 10-12: Full production covering 50+ jurisdictions.

## Stage of Development
**Status:** Pilot ready / Active pilot

Our collaboration with Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity archives federal and North Carolina SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF documents. Researchers at Georgetown and Michigan already use our pilot repository. PolicyEngine's benefits calculators serve thousands of users, with MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Mirza, and Impactica among our API clients. NBER and Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center at Vanderbilt already use PolicyEngine for tax credit modeling. We'll build a web application for document submission and retrieval (beyond current API), seeded with documents from ALL participating organizations: PolicyEngine (2,500+ citations), documents in Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database model (nationwide coverage), GCO's collection (all states and programs), NBER's assembled tax documents via TAXSIM MOU (historical coverage since 2018), Prenatal-to-3's research archive, Better Government Lab and USC research documents, and documents MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator reference in their systems—totaling 5,000+ documents at launch. We'll enrich all with metadata and convert PDFs to plaintext for efficient searching and AI processing.
