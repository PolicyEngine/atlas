Open-source rules engines cannot achieve government credibility without authoritative documentation. Currently, 18% of benefit policy URLs from 2019 are dead, undermining trust in automated eligibility systems that could transform SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF administration. The Policy Library creates permanent, AI-curated documentation infrastructure that rules engines reference, establishing accuracy and coverage essential for government adoption.

Our solution directly addresses PBIF's four priority areas: income verification through state-specific disregards, SNAP error reduction via current criteria access, beneficiary communication with verifiable sources, and backlog reduction by saving caseworker research time. When rules engines cite exact sources, they transform from experimental tools to trusted government infrastructure.

We're not starting from scratch. Existing collaborations with Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, NBER (TAXSIM MOU), Urban Institute, Georgetown, and USC validate this need. MyFriendBen serves 3,500 monthly users; Benefit Navigator reaches 500+ caseworkers; PolicyEngine calculators serve 160,000 annually. Partners waste resources maintaining document libraries while families receive inconsistent information.

Our AI-powered system (Claude/GPT-4) monitors 50+ jurisdictions, capturing documents before they vanish. Human reviewers verify accuracy through GitHub. We provide stable APIs with permanent source IDs, eliminating broken links that plague current systems.

**Year 1:** Establish credibility through comprehensive coverage and nonprofit demonstrations proving 24pp accuracy improvements in LLM benefit calculations. **Year 2:** Government adoption building on proven results from rules-as-code demonstrations.

This infrastructure investment enables innovation for generations. Our $700,000 request catalyzes millions in downstream value across the policy ecosystem, creating permanent public goods that ensure every eligible family can access benefits they deserve.

## Stage of Development
**Status:** Pilot ready / Active pilot

Our collaboration with Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity archives federal and North Carolina SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF documents. Researchers at Georgetown, Michigan, and Urban Institute already use our pilot repository. PolicyEngine's benefits calculators serve thousands of users, with MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Mirza, and Impactica among our API clients. NBER and Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center at Vanderbilt already use PolicyEngine for tax credit modeling. We'll build a web application for document submission and retrieval (beyond current API), seeded with documents from ALL participating organizations: PolicyEngine (2,500+ citations), documents in Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database model (nationwide coverage), GCO's collection (all states and programs), NBER's assembled tax documents via TAXSIM MOU (historical coverage since 2018), Urban Institute's safety net research archive, Prenatal-to-3's research archive, Better Government Lab and USC research documents, and documents MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator reference in their systemsâ€”totaling 5,000+ documents at launch. We'll enrich all with metadata and convert PDFs to plaintext for efficient searching and AI processing.
