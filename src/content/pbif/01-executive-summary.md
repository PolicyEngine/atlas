Open-source rules engines lack credibility without authoritative documentation. Currently, 18% of benefit policy URLs from 2019 are dead, undermining trust in automated eligibility systems. The Policy Library provides permanent, versioned documentation that rules engines reference, establishing accuracy and coverage for government adoption. When rules engines cite exact sources, they transform from experimental tools to trusted infrastructure.

We combine AI-powered monitoring (Claude/GPT-5) with PolicyEngine's rules engine creating intelligent infrastructure. Our system understands document relationships, surfaces non-obvious connections (TANF-SNAP categorical eligibility), providing authoritative ground truth for accurate benefits determination.

**PBIF Priority Impact:** Enable income verification via state-specific disregards, reduce SNAP errors through current criteria, support confident beneficiary communication with sources, reduce backlogs saving staff time.

**Not starting from scratch:** Collaboration with Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Georgia Center for Opportunity, NBER, Urban Institute, Prenatal-to-3, Better Government Lab, USC, MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator continues. We seed the library with nationwide documents. NBER and Prenatal-to-3 use PolicyEngine for tax credit modeling; Mirza and Impactica use our API. Colorado users and Riverside caseworkers see sources with calculations.

**Year 1:** Establish credibility through comprehensive coverage (50+ jurisdictions), nonprofit demonstrations proving accuracy improvements, and open-source templates. **Year 2:** Government adoption building on proven results.

## Stage of Development
**Status:** Pilot ready / Active pilot

Our collaboration with Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity archives federal and North Carolina SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF documents. Researchers at Georgetown, Michigan, and Urban Institute already use our pilot repository. PolicyEngine's benefits calculators serve thousands of users, with MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Mirza, and Impactica among our API clients. NBER and Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center at Vanderbilt already use PolicyEngine for tax credit modeling. We'll build a web application for document submission and retrieval (beyond current API), seeded with documents from ALL participating organizations: PolicyEngine (2,500+ citations), documents in Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database model (nationwide coverage), GCO's collection (all states and programs), NBER's assembled tax documents via TAXSIM MOU (historical coverage since 2018), Urban Institute's safety net research archive, Prenatal-to-3's research archive, Better Government Lab and USC research documents, and documents MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator reference in their systemsâ€”totaling 5,000+ documents at launch. We'll enrich all with metadata and convert PDFs to plaintext for efficient searching and AI processing.
