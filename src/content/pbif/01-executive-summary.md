The Policy Library creates the missing infrastructure layer that transforms how America's safety net operates. Currently, 18% of benefit policy URLs from 2019 are dead, forcing every organization to independently maintain fragile document collections. When tools access our comprehensive, permanently archived source documents, we enable transformative capabilities: AI assistants accurately determining multi-program eligibility without hallucinations, caseworkers confidently navigating complex rules with authoritative sources, researchers tracking policy evolution across jurisdictions, and innovations we haven't imagined.

We'll combine AI-powered monitoring (Claude/GPT-5) with PolicyEngine's open-source rules engine to create intelligent infrastructure. Our system will understand document relationships and surface non-obvious connections like TANF-SNAP categorical eligibility, providing authoritative ground truth for accurate benefits determination. We'll use agentic AI with comprehensive metadata rather than fine-tuning, enabling flexible and accurate document retrieval at scale.

**PBIF Priority Impact:** We'll enable income verification via state-specific disregards, reduce SNAP errors through current criteria, support confident beneficiary communication with source documents, and reduce backlogs to save staff time.

**Not starting from scratch:** Our collaboration with Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Georgia Center for Opportunity, NBER, Urban Institute, Prenatal-to-3, Better Government Lab, USC, MyFriendBen, and Benefit Navigator continues. We'll seed the library with documents covering nationwide scope. NBER and Prenatal-to-3 already use PolicyEngine for tax credit modeling, while Mirza and Impactica use our API. We'll add document display to API requests and integrate caseworker training. Colorado users and Riverside caseworkers will see sources alongside calculations.

**12-month production timeline:** Months 1-3: Launch 5,000+ documents, 10 states; Months 4-6: API v1 with partners; Months 7-9: 30 states; Months 10-12: Full production covering 50+ jurisdictions.

## Stage of Development
**Status:** Pilot ready / Active pilot

Our collaboration with Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity archives federal and North Carolina SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF documents. Researchers at Georgetown, Michigan, and Urban Institute already use our pilot repository. PolicyEngine's benefits calculators serve thousands of users, with MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Mirza, and Impactica among our API clients. NBER and Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center at Vanderbilt already use PolicyEngine for tax credit modeling. We'll build a web application for document submission and retrieval (beyond current API), seeded with documents from ALL participating organizations: PolicyEngine (2,500+ citations), documents in Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database model (nationwide coverage), GCO's collection (all states and programs), NBER's assembled tax documents via TAXSIM MOU (historical coverage since 2018), Urban Institute's safety net research archive, Prenatal-to-3's research archive, Better Government Lab and USC research documents, and documents MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator reference in their systemsâ€”totaling 5,000+ documents at launch. We'll enrich all with metadata and convert PDFs to plaintext for efficient searching and AI processing.
