We will create the Policy Library, cross-cutting infrastructure to collect, update, store, and distribute primary source documents for benefit programs across all US jurisdictions. This permanent archive solves the critical problem of disappearing documents (18% of 2019 URLs are dead) and enables the rules-as-code ecosystem—replacing the current chaos of broken URLs, Google Docs, and PDFs on local machines with stable, citable sources.

To demonstrate the Library's utility in AI contexts and address the $10.5B in annual SNAP errors, we will develop the Clarity Index—an automated scoring system measuring document comprehensibility, AI consistency in benefit calculations, and encoding accuracy. The Index establishes baselines from human raters, correlates scores with SNAP Quality Control error data, and provides agencies specific revisions to improve clarity. This directly addresses PBIF priorities: reducing errors through clearer documentation and enabling open-source rules engines.

Strong partnerships validate demand. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta collaborates on Policy Rules Database integration; NBER leverages our TAXSIM MOU for tax policy analysis; Urban Institute and Georgetown researchers use our pilot archives. MyFriendBen (3,500 monthly users) and Benefit Navigator (500+ caseworkers) demonstrate immediate application—both struggle with interpreting contradictory policy sources.

Our permanent document library provides the stable foundation this analysis requires. AI monitors agency websites, capturing documents before they disappear (18% of 2019 URLs are dead). Human reviewers verify accuracy through GitHub workflows. We provide stable APIs with permanent source IDs, eliminating broken links.

**Coverage commitment:** Latest statutes, regulations, and manuals for tax credits, SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, ACA, WIC, TANF, CCDF, LIHEAP, SSI, and state supplements across all 50 states and DC. We start with 2,500+ documents from PolicyEngine-US, deploy AI agents to fill gaps, and run bounty programs with Urban Institute, Georgia Center for Opportunity, and Atlanta Fed for verification and additions.

**Year 1:** Build comprehensive library, establish Clarity Index baselines, demonstrate correlation with error rates. **Year 2:** Scale to government adoption, proven error reduction.

## Stage of Development
**Status:** Pilot ready / Active pilot

Our collaboration with Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity archives federal and North Carolina SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF documents. Researchers at Georgetown, Michigan, and Urban Institute already use our pilot repository. PolicyEngine's benefits calculators serve thousands of users, with MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Mirza, and Impactica among our API clients. NBER and Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center at Vanderbilt already use PolicyEngine for tax credit modeling. We'll build a web application for document submission and retrieval (beyond current API), seeded with documents from ALL participating organizations: PolicyEngine (2,500+ citations), documents in Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database model (nationwide coverage), GCO's collection (all states and programs), NBER's assembled tax documents via TAXSIM MOU (historical coverage since 2018), Urban Institute's safety net research archive, Prenatal-to-3's research archive, Better Government Lab and USC research documents, and documents MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator reference in their systems—totaling 5,000+ documents at launch. We'll enrich all with metadata and convert PDFs to plaintext for efficient searching and AI processing.
