## Executive Summary (limit 250 words)
*"In a concise summary, describe the core problem your project addresses, the proposed technical solution, the target beneficiaries, and the anticipated impact."*

The Policy Library is cross-cutting infrastructure that directly enables all four PBIF priority areas. Every tool for income verification, SNAP error reduction, beneficiary communication, and backlog reduction fails when the underlying policy documents disappear—which happens constantly as agencies reorganize websites and vendors shut down.

Our AI-powered solution (using Claude/GPT-5) monitors 50+ jurisdictions weekly, permanently archiving statutes, regulations, and implementation memos. Our 100% open-source rules engine (with 100+ contributors) identifies all relevant documents for any eligibility decision—including complex interactions like TANF-SNAP categorical eligibility. We provide stable APIs ensuring caseworkers, advocates, and AI tools always have access to current, authoritative documents.

**Direct PBIF Priority Impact:** (1) Income verification—instant access to state-specific disregard policies; (2) SNAP errors—current eligibility criteria reduce documentation-related errors; (3) Beneficiary communication—advocates can confidently explain rules with source documents; (4) Backlog reduction—staff save significant time currently spent hunting for policy clarifications.

**Not starting from scratch:** Our collaboration with Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Georgia Center for Opportunity continues as we seed the library with documents in our respective models, covering federal programs and North Carolina initially with nationwide scope. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator already use our API for benefit calculations—we propose adding document display as an enhancement to their existing requests ($30k each for deep integration). When Colorado users query benefits through MyFriendBen or Riverside County caseworkers use Benefit Navigator, they'll see primary sources alongside calculations they already receive.

**12-month production timeline:** Months 1-3: Launch with 5,000+ documents from all partners, scale to 10 states; Months 4-6: API v1 with partner integration; Months 7-9: 30 states; Months 10-12: Full production. This infrastructure makes every other PBIF project more reliable and sustainable.

## Stage of Development
**Status:** Pilot ready / Active pilot

Our collaboration with Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity archives federal and North Carolina SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF documents. Researchers at Georgetown and Michigan already use our pilot repository. PolicyEngine's benefits calculators serve thousands of users, with MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator among our API clients. We'll build a web application for document submission and retrieval (beyond current API), seeded with documents from ALL participating organizations: PolicyEngine (2,500+ citations), documents in Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database model (nationwide coverage), GCO's collection (all states and programs), Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center's research archive (they use PolicyEngine for state tax credit modeling), Better Government Lab and USC research documents, and documents MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator reference in their systems—totaling 5,000+ documents at launch. We'll enrich all with metadata and convert PDFs to plaintext for efficient searching and AI processing.
