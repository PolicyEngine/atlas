# Statement of Work - MyFriendBen

**Partner:** MyFriendBen  
**Amount:** $50,000

## Organization Overview

MyFriendBen operates a leading digital benefits screener, serving 3,500+ users monthly and expanding from Colorado to North Carolina, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Texas. Their platform helps vulnerable families navigate complex eligibility requirements for SNAP, Medicaid, WIC, and other safety net programs. As an established PolicyEngine API client, they already integrate our benefits calculations into their screening process. MyFriendBen has received support from the Gates Foundation and Gary Community Ventures (which incubated the organization), among other funders. They are actively cultivating relationships with state agencies across their expansion states.

### Caseworker Training Development
- Collaborate on developing training materials that integrate Policy Library access
- Pilot training with their network of community-based caseworkers
- Provide feedback on training effectiveness and document utility
- Share best practices from implementations across different states

### Technical Integration
