# Statement of Work - MyFriendBen

**Status:** Conditional upon PolicyEngine receiving PBIF award  
**Partner:** MyFriendBen  
**Amount:** $50,000  
**Period:** 24 months  

## Organization Overview

MyFriendBen operates a leading digital benefits screener, serving 3,500+ users monthly and expanding from Colorado to North Carolina, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Texas. Their platform helps vulnerable families navigate complex eligibility requirements for SNAP, Medicaid, WIC, and other safety net programs. As an established PolicyEngine API client, they already integrate our benefits calculations into their screening process. MyFriendBen has received support from the Gates Foundation and Gary Community Ventures (which incubated the organization), among other funders. They are actively cultivating relationships with state agencies across their expansion states.

## Scope of Work

### Document Contribution & Verification
- Identify and contribute policy documents currently referenced in their screening tools across 5 states
- Verify metadata for documents related to programs they cover
- Provide feedback on document organization and accessibility
- Share insights on which documents are most critical for benefits screening

### Rules-as-Code Demonstration
- Demonstrate how Policy Library enables accurate rules encoding in their screening tools
- Track and document accuracy improvements when calculations reference source documents
- Compare error rates between document-backed vs traditional implementations
- Create case studies showing reduced maintenance burden with authoritative sources

### Technical Integration
- Enhance existing PolicyEngine API integration to display relevant policy documents
- Test document retrieval and display features as they become available
- Provide user feedback on document presentation and navigation
- Track usage patterns to inform system improvements

### Government Rules-as-Code Pathway
- Leverage state agency relationships to demonstrate rules-as-code benefits
- Show agencies how document-backed calculations reduce eligibility errors
- Pilot automated policy encoding with interested state partners
- Document cost savings from reduced manual rule interpretation
- Create replicable model for government rules-as-code adoption

## Deliverables

- **Year 1: Rules-as-Code Foundation**
  - Policy documents from 5 states contributed to library
  - Metadata verification for relevant programs
  - Baseline accuracy metrics established for current screening
  - Document-backed calculations implemented in screening tool
  - Accuracy improvement metrics documented
  - Error reduction case studies from Colorado implementation

- **Year 2: Government Rules-as-Code Adoption**
  - Rules-as-code pilot with 1-2 state agencies
  - Automated policy encoding demonstrations
  - Cost-benefit analysis of rules-as-code implementation
  - Open-source templates for government adoption
  - Technical documentation for agency IT teams
  - Sustainability model for government-maintained rules

## Success Metrics

- Number of documents contributed and verified
- Percentage reduction in eligibility determination errors
- Time saved through automated policy interpretation
- Number of rules successfully encoded from documents
- Government agencies adopting rules-as-code approach
- Cost savings from reduced manual rule maintenance
- Open-source rules published for community use

## Budget Allocation

The $50,000 will support:
- Staff time for document identification and verification
- Rules-as-code implementation and testing
- Accuracy measurement and analysis
- Government demonstration projects
- Open-source template development
- Impact measurement and reporting

## Timeline

**Months 1-6:** Document contribution, baseline accuracy measurement
**Months 7-12:** Rules-as-code implementation, accuracy improvement tracking  
**Months 13-18:** Government demonstrations in expansion states
**Months 19-24:** Government adoption pilots, open-source template release

## Funding Contingency

This Statement of Work is contingent upon PolicyEngine receiving funding from the Public Benefit Innovation Fund (PBIF). The scope, timeline, and budget outlined herein will only be executed if the PBIF application is successful. Both parties acknowledge that no financial obligations or work commitments exist until PBIF funding is secured and a formal agreement is executed.
