# Statement of Work - MyFriendBen

**Partner:** MyFriendBen  
**Amount:** $50,000  
**Period:** 24 months  

## Overview

MyFriendBen operates a leading digital benefits screener, serving thousands of users monthly and expanding from Colorado to North Carolina, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Texas. Their platform helps vulnerable families navigate complex eligibility requirements for SNAP, Medicaid, WIC, and other safety net programs. MyFriendBen has received support from the Gates Foundation and Gary Community Ventures (which incubated the organization), among other funders.

As an established PolicyEngine API client, MyFriendBen already integrates our benefits calculations into their screening process. They are actively cultivating relationships with state agencies across their expansion states, positioning them as an ideal demonstration partner for showing how the Policy Library and clarity scoring can improve benefit determination accuracy. With clearer policy documents, MyFriendBen can reduce screening errors and help states understand how document clarity directly impacts beneficiary outcomes.
