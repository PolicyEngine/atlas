# Statement of Work \- Benefit Navigator

**Partner:** Imagine LA \- Benefit Navigator  
**Amount:** $50,000  
**Period:** 24 months

## Overview

The Benefit Navigator provides an AI aided one-stop-shop for federal, state and local benefits and tax credit navigation for caseworkers and their clients. It is currently operating in Los Angeles County and expanding to Riverside County, Alameda County, Washington D.C., Chicago, and New York City. Their platform includes a closed-domain AI chatbot developed through a partnership with Nava, which received funding from the Gates Foundation. The tool serves caseworkers supporting thousands of households monthly.

Central to their closed-domain chatbot is the Benefit Navigator Information Hub, which contains comprehensive, vetted and plain language actionable information for all the benefits and tax credits as well as general veterans benefits and immigration/public charge information. Based on user requests, this Hub information is in the process of being integrated into learning digital video modules for both caseworkers and clients.

As an existing PolicyEngine API client, Benefit Navigator already integrates our calculations into their platform. Through their Riverside County project with Nava Labs (funded by Google), they are using Agentic AI to demonstrate how the Benefit Navigator Calculator (fueled by Policy’s Engine’s) open source rules) and verification tools can be used to fill and submit human vetted,  applications and bi-pass existing administrative complexity.   With the Policy Library and clarity scoring, they will show agencies how clearer documents enable accurate rules-as-code implementations that reduce error rates and align calculations across all stakeholders \-- government systems, caseworkers, and beneficiaries.

## Scope

- Integrate Policy Library and clarity scoring into Information Hub  
- Demonstrate open-source rules-as-code value to government agencies
