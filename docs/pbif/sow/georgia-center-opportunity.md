# Statement of Work - Georgia Center for Opportunity

**Status:** Conditional upon PolicyEngine receiving PBIF award  
**Partner:** Georgia Center for Opportunity  
**Amount:** $30,000  
**Period:** 24 months  

## Organization Overview

Georgia Center for Opportunity (GCO) brings deep technical expertise in benefits modeling and rules engines, operating the benefitscliffs.org platform across 13 states. Their tools model SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and other safety net programs, helping caseworkers, researchers, and policymakers understand benefit interactions and eligibility. GCO has collaborated with PolicyEngine and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on federal and North Carolina pilot implementations focused on document collection and organization. Their extensive document collections and experience building rules engines make them a valuable technical partner for ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## Scope of Work

### Document Contribution
- Contribute policy documents currently used in benefitscliffs.org across 13 states
- Provide documents from federal and North Carolina pilots with Atlanta Fed
- Share implementation guides and technical documentation
- Contribute ongoing documents as new states/programs are added

### Metadata Verification & Enhancement
- Review and verify metadata for contributed documents
- Add technical annotations based on rules engine implementation
- Identify document relationships and dependencies
- Flag superseded documents and policy changes

### Technical Integration Testing
- Test Policy Library API integration with benefitscliffs.org
- Provide feedback on API design for rules engine use cases
- Document integration patterns for other rules engines
- Share performance requirements and optimization needs

### Knowledge Transfer
- Share best practices from building rules engines
- Document how policy documents map to computational rules
- Provide insights on multi-state policy variations
- Contribute to technical documentation for other implementers

## Deliverables

- **Year 1: Document Foundation**
