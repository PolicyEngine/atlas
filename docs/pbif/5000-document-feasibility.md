## Feasibility Assessment

### ✅ **VERDICT: 5,000 documents is achievable by focusing on operational documents**

1. **Comprehensive state coverage** - Must archive documents for all 50 states + DC for each program
2. **Operational focus** - County implementation guides, provider manuals, eligibility procedures
3. **Supporting materials** - Forms, worksheets, and guidance documents that caseworkers actually use

### Key Insights

- **Strengths**: PolicyEngine already has excellent tax credit coverage (742 docs)
- **Low-hanging fruit**: LIHEAP, WIC, and CHIP have minimal coverage (28 docs total) - expanding to 50 states adds 500+ documents
- **Multiplier effect**: Each program × 50 states × multiple document types (eligibility manual, forms, provider guides) quickly scales
- **Operational necessity**: Focus on documents that benefit navigators and caseworkers need daily

## Recommendation

**Keep the 5,000 document target** but clarify in the proposal that this includes:
- Complete federal coverage for all 10 programs
- All 50 states + DC for each program  
- Operational documents (eligibility manuals, provider agreements, forms)
- County-level implementation materials where programs vary locally

This positions the Policy Library as essential infrastructure for benefit delivery, not just research.
