## Path to 5,000 Documents

### Required Additions (3,167 documents needed)

1. **State Program Expansion** (~1,350 documents)
   - SNAP: Add 116 documents (50 states - current 34)
   - Medicaid: Add 156 documents (state plans, waivers)
   - TANF: Add 114 documents (state plans)
   - LIHEAP: Add 138 documents (50 states - current 12)
   - WIC: Add 91 documents (state agency docs)
   - CCDF: Add 84 documents (state plans)
   - CHIP: Add 93 documents (state programs)
   - ACA marketplaces: Add 85 documents (36 states)
   - SSI state supplements: Add 100 documents (30 states)
   - State tax forms: Add 250 documents (~5 per state)
   - Remaining state income tax: Add 200 documents

2. **Historical Versions** (~1,000 documents)
   - 2020-2024 versions of key statutes
   - Prior year tax forms
   - Previous program manuals
   - Historical eligibility rules

3. **Supporting Documents** (~650 documents)
   - Regulatory guidance & memos: 300 documents
   - Application forms: 200 documents
   - Eligibility manuals: 150 documents

### Total Projection
- Current unique documents: 1,833
- Required additions: 3,167
- **Total projected: 5,000** ✅

## Feasibility Assessment

### ✅ **VERDICT: 5,000 documents is achievable but requires:**

1. **Comprehensive state coverage** - Must archive documents for all 50 states + DC for each program
2. **Historical documents** - Including 2020-2024 versions is essential to reach target
3. **Supporting materials** - Forms, manuals, and guidance documents beyond just statutes

### Key Insights

- **Strengths**: PolicyEngine already has excellent tax credit coverage (742 docs)
- **Low-hanging fruit**: LIHEAP, WIC, and CHIP have minimal coverage (28 docs total) - expanding to 50 states adds 300+ documents
- **Multiplier effect**: Each program × 50 states × multiple document types quickly scales
- **Historical necessity**: Without historical versions, reaching 5,000 would be very difficult

## Recommendation

**Keep the 5,000 document target** but clarify in the proposal that this includes:
- Complete federal coverage for all 10 programs
- All 50 states + DC for each program
- Key historical versions (2020-2024) for tracking policy changes
- Essential supporting documents (forms, manuals, guidance)

This positions the Policy Library as truly comprehensive while remaining achievable within the 2-year grant period.
