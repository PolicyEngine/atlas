## Key Changes from Initial Draft

Based on reviewer feedback, we've made several important clarifications:

1. **Focus on Organizations**: Emphasized that the primary users are organizations helping Americans (caseworkers, navigator tools, researchers), not beneficiaries directly
2. **Policy Communication, Not Changes**: Clarified that the Clarity Index helps improve how policies are communicated, not changing policy substance
3. **Accurate Claims**: Removed unsubstantiated claims about testing; only stated what PolicyEngine has actually built
4. **Technical Corrections**: Removed Git LFS references; added plaintext conversion for machine readability
