## Detailed Evaluation

### Impact (21/25)
This tackles a real problem I've seen from multiple angles - as an educator, nonprofit leader, and White House advisor. When we designed maker education programs that intersected with benefits, finding current policy documents was a constant challenge.

The clarity scoring is brilliant - it gamifies policy writing in a productive way. States might actually compete to have clearer policies. This reminds me of successful White House initiatives that used metrics to drive behavior change.

Strong beneficiary reach through partners. The connection to direct service providers (MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator) ensures real-world impact, not just theoretical benefit.

*Missing*: Youth and family perspective. How do young people and families experience these document challenges?

### Responsible AI (18/20)
Smart approach to AI that enhances human capability rather than replacing it. The GitHub PR review process teaches AI governance through practice - very maker movement philosophy. Bounty program democratizes participation.

The LLM benchmark is clever - concrete evidence for AI value that skeptics can understand. This could help other nonprofits make the case for AI adoption.

*From education perspective*: Could involve students/youth in document verification for workforce development.

### Technical & Practical Feasibility (19/20)
Excellent pragmatic approach. At Digital Harbor, we've learned that simple, proven technology beats complex solutions. Git, REST APIs, standard models - this will actually work.

The bounty program is particularly clever - creates economic opportunity while solving the problem. This could engage gig workers, students, and others who need flexible income.

PolicyEngine's track record matters. They've shipped real products used by 160,000 people. This isn't their first rodeo.

*Suggestion*: Consider badges/credentials for community reviewers - workforce development opportunity.

### Strategic Alignment (17/20)
Good fit with PBIF priorities. From my White House experience, this is exactly the type of infrastructure that government needs but can't build through traditional procurement.

The modest budget shows maturity. They're not trying to boil the ocean, just solve a specific problem well.

*Could strengthen*: Connection to workforce development and digital equity missions.

### Shared Learning and Scale (14/15)
Strong commitment to open source and knowledge sharing. Academic partnerships ensure research applications. The API approach enables broad ecosystem adoption.

From Digital Harbor's experience, open infrastructure projects create unexpected innovations. Others will build on this in ways we can't predict.

*Opportunity*: Create curriculum for students to learn civic tech through document verification.

## Key Strengths
1. **Solves real problem every service provider faces**
2. **Clever use of incentives (bounties, clarity scoring)**
3. **Proven team that ships real products**
4. **Democratic approach that creates opportunities**
5. **Simple technology that will actually work**

## Key Concerns
1. **Youth engagement**: Missing opportunity for workforce development
2. **Community ownership**: How do communities shape what's collected?
3. **Digital equity**: Will this widen or narrow digital divides?
4. **Baltimore representation**: No Baltimore/Maryland partners listed

## Questions for Round 3
1. How could this project create workforce development opportunities for youth?
2. What's your plan for engaging communities in deciding what documents matter?
3. How will you ensure this doesn't widen digital divides?
4. Could you pilot in Baltimore with our youth programs?
5. What role could students play in document verification and quality control?
6. How does this connect to digital literacy and civic education?

## Recommendation
**FUND** - $800,000 with community engagement requirement

This solves a real problem with a practical approach. The team can execute, and the partnerships are meaningful. From my White House and nonprofit experience, this is exactly the type of infrastructure that enables innovation.

**Required additions**:
1. **Youth engagement component**: Create pathways for students to participate in document verification
2. **Community advisory board**: Include voices from affected communities
3. **Digital equity audit**: Ensure solution doesn't widen divides
4. **Workforce development**: Create credentials/badges for reviewers
5. **Baltimore pilot**: Test with Digital Harbor youth programs

**Why this matters**:
At Digital Harbor, we teach youth to solve real problems with technology. This project could be a perfect learning opportunity - students could verify documents while learning about civic systems and earning income.

The clarity scoring could revolutionize government communication. During my White House service, we constantly struggled with agencies writing incomprehensible policies. This creates accountability.

**Strategic opportunity**:
This could become a model for civic tech workforce development. Young people could earn money while making government more accessible. The bounty model could be replicated for other civic challenges.

Consider partnering with youth-serving organizations to make document verification a workforce development opportunity. With proper framing, this boring but essential work becomes a pathway to civic engagement and tech careers.
