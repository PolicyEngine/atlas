### The Bottom Line

As Cassandra Madison (PBIF ED) noted: "This is exactly what PBIF should fund - unsexy but critical infrastructure that transforms government operations." 

The near-unanimous strong support from leadership (90.8/100 average), combined with the pragmatic approach and proven team, makes this a clear funding recommendation. The modest original ask actually undersells the potential - this could become foundational infrastructure for America's safety net.

With proper conditions and increased funding for search and equity, this project could save states millions in error corrections while helping millions of Americans access benefits more easily.
