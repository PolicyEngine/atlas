# Review Summary and Recommendations

## Overall Scores
- **Reviewer 1 (Government Tech)**: 88/100 - FUND
- **Reviewer 2 (Benefits Policy)**: 88/100 - FUND  
- **Reviewer 3 (AI/Product)**: 87/100 - FUND WITH CONDITIONS
- **Average**: 87.7/100

## Consensus Strengths
All three reviewers agreed on these key strengths:

1. **Addresses Critical Infrastructure Gap**: Every reviewer recognized this as a real, painful problem that affects government agencies, researchers, and service providers daily

2. **Strong Partnership Coalition**: The mix of direct service tools (MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator), research institutions (Georgetown, NBER, Prenatal-to-3), and government connections provides credibility

3. **Proven Team Execution**: PolicyEngine's track record of serving 160,000 users demonstrates capability to deliver

4. **Innovation in Clarity Scoring**: All reviewers highlighted this as potentially transformative for how policies are written

5. **Appropriate Technical Approach**: Simple, proven technologies (Git, REST APIs, established AI models) rather than overly complex solutions

## Consensus Concerns
Common concerns across reviewers:

1. **Sustainability Beyond Grant Period**: All reviewers questioned what happens after PBIF funding ends

2. **Equity in Document Collection**: Risk of systematic bias in which documents are collected and prioritized

3. **Scale Challenges**: Storage costs, search infrastructure, and API management at 100,000+ documents

4. **End Beneficiary Impact**: Metrics focus on intermediate outcomes rather than direct beneficiary results

## Divergent Perspectives

### Government Tech Reviewer
- Most concerned about disaster recovery and government adoption
- Wanted direct state agency commitment letter
- Suggested increasing funding to $1M

### Benefits Policy Reviewer  
- Focused on equity and multilingual access
- Wanted more frontline worker engagement
- Concerned about political sensitivities

### AI/Product Reviewer
- Highlighted missing search/discovery features
- Questioned why PolicyEngine hasn't built this already
- Most detailed on technical implementation gaps

## Questions for Round 3 (Technical Deep Dive)

### Priority Questions (asked by multiple reviewers)
1. How will you ensure equitable document collection across all states and counties?
2. What's the detailed sustainability plan after grant funding?
3. How will users actually find and discover relevant documents?
4. What's your approach to non-English documents?

### Technical Questions
5. How will you handle storage costs at scale with Git LFS?
6. What's the disaster recovery plan?
7. How do you handle conflicting or superseded documents?
8. What are the specific API rate limits and abuse prevention measures?

### Impact Questions
9. What specific metrics define success for government adoption?
10. How will you measure impact on beneficiary outcomes, not just document counts?
11. How will you engage frontline caseworkers in the design process?

## Final Recommendation

### Decision: FUND with Conditions and Increased Budget

**Recommended Funding**: $900,000 - $1,000,000 (increased from requested $700,000)

### Required Conditions
1. **Develop comprehensive sustainability plan** including potential revenue models, governance structure for long-term preservation, and contingency if PolicyEngine pivots

2. **Add search and discovery infrastructure** to the technical specification and budget

3. **Create equity framework** for document collection ensuring coverage of:
   - Smaller/rural counties
   - Non-English documents
   - Historically underserved populations

4. **Establish clear success metrics** including:
   - Government adoption targets (at least 3 states)
   - API integration goals (10+ tools)
   - Beneficiary impact measures

5. **Form advisory councils**:
   - Frontline caseworker advisory group
   - State government technical advisory board
   - Academic research council

### Suggested Modifications
- Allocate additional funding specifically for search infrastructure ($100K)
- Require quarterly reports on equity metrics in document collection
- Add requirement for multilingual strategy within first 6 months
- Include specific deliverables for practitioner-facing tools, not just APIs

## Why Fund This Project

This is exactly the type of unsexy but critical infrastructure that philanthropic funding should support. It's a public good with no clear commercial model, yet it's foundational for improving benefits delivery. The team has proven execution capability, meaningful partnerships, and an innovative approach with the clarity scoring.

The modest original ask of $700K actually undersells the project's potential. With proper funding and the conditions above, this could become the authoritative source for all US safety net policy documentation - a resource that would benefit millions of Americans indirectly through better tools, clearer policies, and reduced administrative burden.

The strongest indicator of success is that the applicant (PolicyEngine) desperately needs this for their own product. They're solving their own problem, which means they're likely to follow through even when things get difficult.
