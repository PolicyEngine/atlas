## Detailed Evaluation

### Impact (24/25)
This proposal directly addresses the document chaos I witnessed firsthand at Vermont's Health Exchange. When we integrated eligibility systems for 220,000 Vermonters, missing or outdated policy documents caused weeks of delays and thousands of incorrect determinations. We saw significant failure rates during our Medicaid modernization.

The clarity scoring feature is brilliant and overdue. Ambiguous policy language was the #1 cause of caseworker errors in Vermont. If we could have quantified which policies caused confusion, we could have prioritized rewrites and saved millions in error corrections.

The partner reach is impressive - 72,000 households through PolicyEngine, direct state contracts through MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator. This isn't theoretical impact.

### Responsible AI (19/20)
Excellent governance approach with GitHub PR reviews creating transparency and audit trails. The human verification through bounties is smart - leverages community while maintaining quality. Focus on public documents eliminates PII concerns that kill government projects.

The LLM benchmark showing accuracy improvement with documents is compelling data for the next generation of eligibility systems. This could justify AI adoption in conservative government environments.

*Minor note*: Would like to see explicit commitment to government AI ethics frameworks (NIST AI Risk Management Framework).

### Technical & Practical Feasibility (19/20)
The technical approach is refreshingly practical. During Vermont's turnaround, we succeeded by choosing boring, proven technology over flashy solutions. Git, REST APIs, established AI models - this is the right approach for government-adjacent infrastructure.

PolicyEngine's track record is crucial - 160,000 users proves they can scale. The bounty program at $10-30 per document batch is sustainable and clever - much better than trying to hire reviewers.

Having led a $70M technology portfolio, I appreciate their modest budget. They're not trying to boil the ocean.

### Strategic Alignment (19/20)
Perfect fit for PBIF's mission. This is exactly the type of infrastructure that government needs but can't build - no procurement vehicle, no budget line item, but absolutely essential.

The partnerships demonstrate real government connections. MyFriendBen's Colorado contract and Benefit Navigator's multi-state presence show this will reach government systems, not just float in the nonprofit space.

Building on past Ballmer Group investments (Beeck Center, Benefits Data Trust) shows thoughtful positioning in the ecosystem.

### Shared Learning and Scale (14/15)
Strong open source commitment. Academic partnerships ensure research dissemination. API-first design enables broad adoption.

*Suggestion*: Could strengthen government-to-government knowledge transfer plans. How will successful states share implementation lessons?

## Key Strengths
1. **Solves universal government pain point**: Every state struggles with this
2. **Practical, achievable technical approach**: Not trying to revolutionize, just execute
3. **Strong execution team**: PolicyEngine has shipped at scale
4. **Clear path to government adoption**: Through existing partner contracts
5. **Modest, responsible budget**: Shows maturity and focus

## Key Concerns
1. **Long-term governance**: What happens to the archive if PolicyEngine pivots?
2. **State adoption incentives**: How to motivate states to officially adopt?
3. **Federal alignment**: Any coordination with federal document initiatives?

## Questions for Round 3
1. How will you coordinate with federal initiatives like USA.gov's benefits content?
2. What's your strategy for getting official state endorsement vs. just usage?
3. How do you plan to handle the politics when states don't want certain policies easily accessible?
4. Can you detail the disaster recovery and long-term preservation plan?
5. How will you measure reduction in eligibility determination errors?

## Recommendation
**STRONGLY FUND** - Increase to $1.2M

This is exactly what PBIF should fund - unsexy but critical infrastructure that transforms government operations. Having led Vermont's eligibility system turnaround, I know firsthand how desperately this is needed. The team can execute, the partnerships are real, and the approach is sound.

Recommend increasing funding to $1.2M to:
- Accelerate rollout to more states
- Build proper search infrastructure
- Establish independent governance structure for long-term preservation
- Create state implementation playbooks

**Conditions**:
1. Establish advisory board with state government representatives
2. Develop metrics for error reduction in eligibility determinations
3. Create sustainability plan including potential state funding model
4. Align with federal digital service initiatives

This could become as foundational as USA.gov for the benefits ecosystem. The clarity scoring alone could drive a revolution in how government writes policy. With proper support, this project could save states millions in error corrections while helping millions of Americans access benefits they're entitled to.

The fact that PolicyEngine desperately needs this for their own product gives me confidence they'll see it through. This is personal for them, not just another grant.
