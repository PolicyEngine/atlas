# Reviewer 3: AI/Product Strategy Expert  
**Background**: Former Head of Product at Code for America; Technical advisor to 2022 Safety Net Product Studio cohort

## Scoring Summary
- **Impact**: 21/25
- **Responsible AI**: 18/20
- **Technical & Practical Feasibility**: 17/20
- **Strategic Alignment**: 17/20
- **Shared Learning and Scale**: 14/15
- **TOTAL**: 87/100

## Detailed Evaluation

### Impact (21/25)
The problem is real and painful. When we built GetCalFresh, we spent months just finding and verifying current policy documents. This would have saved us enormous time. We found significant dead link rates for county-level documents.

The clarity scoring is innovative and could drive real behavior change. States might actually start writing clearer policies if they know they're being scored. The LLM accuracy improvement with documents is compelling for the next generation of benefits tools.

*Concerns*: 
- Impact metrics focus on intermediate outcomes (documents archived, clarity scores) rather than end beneficiary outcomes
- The SNAP error reduction claims may be a stretch - documents are just one piece

### Responsible AI (18/20)
Excellent approach to AI governance. The GitHub PR review process creates transparency and audit trails. Smart to combine AI crawling with human verification through bounties. The focus on public documents only eliminates most privacy concerns.

The LLM benchmark comparing accuracy with/without source documents is clever - quantifies the value proposition for other AI tools. Good thinking about bias in terms of which documents AI might systematically miss.

*Minor concern*: Could be more explicit about model versioning and reproducibility as AI models evolve.

### Technical & Practical Feasibility (17/20)
The technical architecture is sound and boring (in a good way). Git for versioning, standard REST APIs, proven AI models. Not trying to be too clever. The team has shipped complex products - PolicyEngine serves 160,000 users, which shows execution capability.

The bounty program is smart product thinking - leverages community rather than trying to hire everyone. The $10-30 per document batch pricing seems sustainable.

*Concerns*:
- Storage costs for 100,000+ documents could explode, especially with Git LFS
- No mention of search infrastructure - how do users find relevant documents?
- API rate limiting and abuse prevention not discussed

### Strategic Alignment (17/20)
Good fit for PBIF priorities around reducing administrative burden and improving AI in benefits delivery. Builds on previous investments (Benefits Data Trust, Beeck Center). The partnerships with MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator show connection to real government contracts.

The modest $700K ask is actually too low - they could effectively use more funding. This is the kind of boring but critical infrastructure that needs philanthropic support.

*Concern*: Could be stronger on the "wouldn't happen without PBIF" argument - why hasn't PolicyEngine built this already?

### Shared Learning and Scale (14/15)
Strong open source commitment. Good geographic distribution through partners. The academic partnerships ensure research dissemination. API-first design enables integration into any tool.

The combination of technical documentation, academic papers, and practitioner tools shows thoughtful approach to knowledge sharing.

*Minor concern*: Light on specific metrics for adoption success - how many integrations constitute success?

## Key Strengths
1. **Solves urgent, widespread problem**: Every benefits tech tool needs reliable document access
2. **Smart product strategy**: AI + human verification, bounties for scaling, API-first design
3. **Proven team execution**: PolicyEngine has shipped at scale, partners have government relationships
4. **Innovation in clarity scoring**: Could change how policies are written, not just accessed

## Key Concerns
1. **Sustainability model unclear**: What happens after PBIF funding ends?
2. **Search and discovery underspecified**: Having documents isn't enough if people can't find them
3. **Scale challenges**: Storage, search, and API costs could balloon

## Questions for Round 3
1. Walk through the user journey - how does a caseworker or developer actually find the document they need?
2. What's your approach to search ranking and relevance? 
3. How will you handle storage costs at scale? Have you modeled the unit economics?
4. Why hasn't PolicyEngine built this already if it's so valuable to their users?
5. What specific metrics will you track for adoption and integration success?
6. How do you plan to sustain this after the grant period?

## Recommendation
**FUND WITH CONDITIONS** - This is critical infrastructure that the ecosystem desperately needs. The team can execute, the partnerships are real, and the technical approach is sound. However, several concerns need addressing:

**Conditions**:
1. Develop clear sustainability plan beyond grant period
2. Add comprehensive search/discovery product spec
3. Include specific adoption metrics and targets
4. Consider increasing budget to $900K-1M for proper search infrastructure

This reminds me of early Code for America infrastructure projects - not sexy, but foundational for everything else. The clarity scoring innovation could be transformative. The fact that they're solving their own problem (PolicyEngine needs these documents) gives confidence they'll follow through.

The team should think bigger - this could be the foundation for a new generation of benefits tools. With proper search and discovery, this becomes the authoritative source for all benefits policy, not just an archive.
