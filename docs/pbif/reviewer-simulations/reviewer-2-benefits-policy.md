## Detailed Evaluation

### Impact (23/25)
This addresses a fundamental research infrastructure gap. I've personally experienced the frustration of citing a state TANF manual only to have the link break before publication. The academic community loses countless hours re-finding documents that agencies relocate or remove.

The clarity scoring could revolutionize how we measure administrative burden. If we can quantify which policies create confusion, we can finally make evidence-based arguments for simplification. The connection to error rates is particularly compelling.

The beneficiary impact through partners is substantial - 72,000 households through PolicyEngine, thousands more through MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator. These aren't hypothetical users.

*Minor concern*: Would like to see more direct beneficiary input in the design process.

### Responsible AI (16/20)
The human-in-the-loop approach via GitHub PRs is appropriate. Good that they're only handling public documents. The transparency about AI vs human contributions builds trust.

*Concerns*: 
- How will they handle the inherent biases in which documents agencies choose to digitize? 
- Need more detail on fairness metrics - will all states get equal attention, or will larger states dominate?
- What about Spanish-language and other non-English documents?

### Technical & Practical Feasibility (16/20)
The partnership mix is excellent - direct service providers, researchers, and policy organizations. The Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center's involvement adds credibility. Their existing document collection provides a strong starting point.

The technical approach seems achievable, building on PolicyEngine's proven infrastructure. The bot using Claude/GPT-4 for intelligent crawling is smart.

*Concerns*:
- The 100,000 document target seems arbitrary. Quality matters more than quantity.
- How will they handle conflicting documents (e.g., state guidance that contradicts federal rules)?
- Document validation process needs more detail - what constitutes "authoritative"?

### Strategic Alignment (19/20)
Perfectly aligned with PBIF priorities. Reduces administrative burden, improves benefits access, and uses AI responsibly. The focus on safety net programs (SNAP, Medicaid, TANF) is spot-on.

Builds thoughtfully on existing work - references Benefits Data Trust, Ballmer Group's past investments. The modest $700K budget shows fiscal responsibility. This is infrastructure that should exist but doesn't because there's no market incentive.

### Shared Learning and Scale (14/15)
Strong commitment to open source and academic partnerships. The NBER and Georgetown involvement ensures research community engagement. The API design enables integration into existing tools.

The geographic diversity of partners (Colorado, Georgia, Tennessee, etc.) suggests good coverage. Academic publications planned will disseminate learnings.

*Minor concern*: Could strengthen plans for practitioner-oriented dissemination (not just academic papers).

## Key Strengths
1. **Addresses fundamental infrastructure gap**: Every researcher and advocate needs this
2. **Strong theory of change**: Documents → Clarity → Reduced errors → Better outcomes
3. **Impressive partner coalition**: Mix of service delivery, research, and policy orgs
4. **Builds on proven foundation**: PolicyEngine's existing tools and user base

## Key Concerns
1. **Equity in document collection**: Risk of reinforcing existing biases about which policies matter
2. **Quality control at scale**: How to maintain standards with bounty program?
3. **Practitioner engagement**: Mostly focused on researchers and service providers, less on caseworkers

## Questions for Round 3
1. How will you ensure equitable coverage across states, especially those with less digital infrastructure?
2. What's your approach to non-English documents, particularly Spanish?
3. How will you engage frontline caseworkers in identifying which documents they actually need?
4. Can you provide more detail on the document authority verification process?
5. How will you handle the politics when states don't want certain policies easily accessible?

## Recommendation
**FUND** - This is essential infrastructure for the benefits access ecosystem. The research community desperately needs this, as do service providers and advocates. The team has the right mix of technical capability and domain expertise.

The modest budget actually concerns me - consider increasing to $1M-1.2M to ensure comprehensive coverage and stronger quality control. Add requirements for:
- Equity metrics in document collection
- Multilingual document strategy
- Frontline worker advisory council

This project fills a critical gap that no one else is addressing. The clarity scoring innovation alone could transform how we write and evaluate policy. The permanent archiving ensures we can track policy evolution and learn from history. This is exactly what philanthropic funding should support - public goods that the market won't provide.
