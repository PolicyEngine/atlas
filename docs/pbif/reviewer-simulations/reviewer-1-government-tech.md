## Detailed Evaluation

### Impact (22/25)
This directly addresses the document management nightmare every state faces. We lost critical Medicaid waiver documentation during our last system migration. The permanent archiving with stable source_ids would have saved us months of rework.

The clarity scoring is brilliant. Most policy manuals are written by lawyers for lawyers, not for the caseworkers who need to apply them daily. Quantifying ambiguity could drive real improvements in how states write policy.

*Concern*: The SNAP error reduction potential may be optimistic. Document availability is one factor, but training, system design, and caseload also drive errors.

### Responsible AI (17/20)
Good approach to AI governance with human review via GitHub PRs. The transparency of showing which documents AI found vs human-contributed builds trust. Smart to focus on public documents only - avoids PII concerns that kill government projects.

*Concern*: Need more detail on bias in AI crawling. Will it systematically miss documents from smaller counties or non-English sources? What about accessibility compliance for archived documents?

### Technical & Practical Feasibility (18/20)
The technical approach is refreshingly simple - Git for versioning, standard APIs, proven AI models. Not trying to reinvent the wheel. The pilot with Atlanta Fed shows they can execute. Having PolicyEngine's existing infrastructure (160,000 users) provides credibility.

The bounty program for human verification is clever - much more scalable than hiring an army of reviewers. $10-30 per document batch seems reasonable.

*Concern*: Git LFS for massive PDFs could get expensive. Have they modeled storage costs at scale?

### Strategic Alignment (18/20)
Perfect fit for PBIF's focus on reducing administrative burden. Builds on existing investments (references Benefits Data Trust, Code for America approaches). The $700K ask is modest - they could probably use more funding effectively.

The government partnerships are real - MyFriendBen has Colorado state contract, Benefit Navigator works with multiple states. This isn't vaporware.

### Shared Learning and Scale (13/15)
Open source commitment is strong. The academic partnerships (Georgetown, NBER, Michigan) ensure research community benefits. API design looks standard and documentable.

*Concern*: Sustainability model depends on PolicyEngine's business model succeeding. What if they pivot or fold? Need stronger governance structure for long-term preservation.

## Key Strengths
1. **Solves real problem**: Every state struggles with document management and policy clarity
2. **Strong partnerships**: Mix of direct service tools, researchers, and government connections
3. **Proven team**: PolicyEngine has shipped complex systems used by 160,000 people

## Key Concerns
1. **Sustainability risk**: Depends heavily on PolicyEngine's continued existence
2. **Bias mitigation**: Need more detail on ensuring comprehensive document collection
3. **Government adoption**: No direct state agency commitment letters (though partners have relationships)

## Questions for Round 3
1. How will you ensure document collection doesn't systematically miss rural counties or non-digital policies?
2. What's the disaster recovery plan if PolicyEngine fails as a company?
3. Can you get at least one state agency to commit to using this as their primary document system?
4. How will you handle versioning when policies change mid-year?

## Recommendation
**FUND** - This solves a real, painful problem every state faces. The technical approach is sound, the team has proven execution ability, and the partnerships are meaningful. The modest budget request ($700K) provides good value. 

Consider increasing funding to $1M to accelerate deployment to more states and strengthen the sustainability model. Require quarterly check-ins on government adoption metrics.

This is exactly the kind of unsexy but critical infrastructure that philanthropic funding should support. Commercial vendors won't build this because there's no clear profit model, but the public benefit is enormous.
