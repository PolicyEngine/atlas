- Implementation Plan: 11/15
- Team & Partnerships: 7/10

**Total Score: 78/100**

**Assessment:**
"The Policy Library addresses real problems that community organizations face daily. I've seen firsthand how broken links and disappeared documents create barriers for families trying to access benefits. Case workers spend hours tracking down basic eligibility information that should be readily available - time that could be spent helping families.

The technical approach seems sound, though I worry about community adoption beyond the well-resourced organizations already in their network. The partner list is impressive - Atlanta Fed, NBER, USC - but where are the grassroots community-based organizations? The ones actually serving families in housing projects and rural communities?

I appreciate that they plan to offer free API access, but that doesn't address the deeper capacity challenges. Many community organizations lack technical staff to integrate APIs or developers to build custom tools. The 'human-in-the-loop' validation sounds good, but will those humans understand the cultural context of documents affecting immigrant communities?"

**Strengths:**
- Addresses genuine community pain points around document access
- Technically feasible solution with proven team
- Commitment to open source maximizes community benefit potential
- Partner validation demonstrates real demand from service organizations
- Sustainable business model could support long-term community access

**Concerns:**
- Limited community voice in design and implementation
- Partner network skews toward well-resourced institutions
- No clear workforce development or community capacity building components
- Technical solutions may not address underlying digital divide issues
- Missing community ownership and governance structures

**Community-Centered Recommendations:**
- Create community advisory board with benefit recipients and grassroots advocates
- Add explicit workforce development component (community curator positions)
- Develop no-code interfaces for non-technical organizations
- Partner with community colleges for technical capacity building
- Include community organization grants for API integration support

**Recommendation: FUND WITH CONDITIONS**

"The infrastructure value is clear, but implementation needs stronger community engagement. The conditions I'm recommending would transform this from a technically excellent project into a truly community-responsive initiative. With these modifications, it could model how to build inclusive civic technology infrastructure."
