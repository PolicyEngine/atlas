# PolicyEngine Atlas - PBIF Reviewer Evaluations

## Evaluation Against PBIF Criteria

### 1. AI-Driven Innovation (Weight: 35%)
**Score: Excellent**

PolicyEngine Atlas exemplifies AI-driven innovation by:
- **Claude/GPT-4 Powered Analysis**: Analyzes thousands of policy documents to identify ambiguity patterns correlating with error rates
- **Clarity Index**: First-of-its-kind metric showing governments exactly which policy language causes errors
- **Intelligent Crawling**: AI automatically identifies and extracts relevant policy documents from agency websites
- **Knowledge Graph Discovery**: Reveals hidden eligibility pathways (e.g., TANF→SNAP→Lifeline chains) invisible to traditional search
- **LLM Benchmark**: Measuring 24pp accuracy improvement when AI has access to authoritative sources

### 2. Administrative Burden Reduction (Weight: 30%)
**Score: Excellent**

Direct impact on burden reduction:
- **Caseworker Efficiency**: Reduces document search time from hours to seconds through instant access and eligibility pathway discovery
- **Rules Engine Accuracy**: Makes tools like MyFriendBen (3,500 users) and Benefit Navigator (500+ caseworkers) trustworthy through source verification
- **Error Prevention**: States with clearer policies (measured by Clarity Index) show lower SNAP error rates, reducing rework
- **Cross-Jurisdiction Learning**: Agencies learn from peers' successful policy language, avoiding reinventing solutions

### 3. Scalability & Impact (Weight: 20%)
**Score: Strong**

Proven scalability approach:
- **Existing Reach**: PolicyEngine serves 72,000 households annually; partners reach 160,000 individuals
- **Force Multiplier Design**: Every rules-as-code project benefits from infrastructure (dozens of calculators)
- **50+ Jurisdictions Year 1**: Federal + all states deployment timeline with NC pilot already complete
- **100,000+ Documents**: Comprehensive coverage ensuring no critical policy missing

### 4. Technical Feasibility (Weight: 15%)
**Score: Excellent**

Demonstrated technical capability:
- **Working Pilots**: North Carolina repository operational with Atlanta Fed collaboration
- **Proven Architecture**: Git + LFS for documents, OpenSearch for queries, stable API with permanent IDs
- **Partner Validation**: Urban Institute, Georgia Center for Opportunity experts validate through bounty program
- **MCP Server Integration**: Native support for AI assistants to query documents directly

## Comparative Advantage

### Unique Positioning
PolicyEngine Atlas is the only solution that:
1. **Connects Three Layers**: Documents → PolicyEngine encoded rules → Eligibility pathways
2. **Serves Three Audiences**: Rules developers, benefit navigators, government agencies
3. **Provides Clarity Metrics**: Quantifies relationship between policy language and error rates

### Why This Matters Now
- **18% of 2019 benefit URLs are dead** - problem accelerating
- **44 states fail SNAP error thresholds** - costing billions annually
- **AI tools need authoritative sources** - hallucination prevention critical for government trust

### Sustainability Model
- **Year 1-2**: PBIF funding for infrastructure build
- **Year 3+**: Self-sustaining through PolicyEngine API revenue and potential government contracts
- **Open Source**: Maximizes adoption and community contribution

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Document Accuracy**: Human expert validation through bounty program
- **API Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA with redundant storage
- **Privacy**: No PII collected; only public policy documents

### Adoption Risks
- **Partner Commitment**: Letters of support from MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Atlanta Fed
- **Government Trust**: Prove value through nonprofit deployment first
- **Sustainability**: PolicyEngine's existing revenue model provides long-term support

## Expected Outcomes

### Year 1 Deliverables
- 50+ jurisdiction coverage with 100,000+ documents
- Integration with 3+ major benefit navigation tools
- Clarity Index showing correlation with error rates
- LLM benchmark proving 24pp accuracy improvement

### Long-term Impact
- **Billions in error reduction** through clearer policies
- **Millions more accessing benefits** through revealed pathways
- **Transformation of safety net** from fragmented to integrated system

## Reviewer Questions Anticipated

**Q: How is this different from existing document repositories?**
A: We don't just store documents - we connect them to encoded rules, reveal eligibility pathways, and measure clarity impact on errors. No one else provides this integrated intelligence layer.

**Q: Why should government trust AI analysis of their policies?**
A: Human experts validate all findings. The Clarity Index is correlation-based, not prescriptive. Agencies choose how to use insights.

**Q: How do you ensure document accuracy?**
A: Three-layer validation: AI extraction, human expert review through bounties, continuous monitoring for changes. Version control tracks all modifications.

**Q: What happens after PBIF funding ends?**
A: PolicyEngine's API revenue model (already serving 72,000 households) sustains operations. Government contracts likely once value proven.

## Scoring Summary

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| AI Innovation | 35% | Excellent (5/5) | 1.75 |
| Burden Reduction | 30% | Excellent (5/5) | 1.50 |
| Scalability | 20% | Strong (4/5) | 0.80 |
| Feasibility | 15% | Excellent (5/5) | 0.75 |
| **Total** | **100%** | | **4.80/5.00** |

## Final Assessment

PolicyEngine Atlas represents a transformative investment in America's safety net infrastructure. By making fragmented systems work as one, we enable billions in error reduction while helping millions access benefits they're entitled to. The combination of AI innovation, proven partnerships, and sustainable business model makes this an ideal PBIF investment with outsized impact potential.
