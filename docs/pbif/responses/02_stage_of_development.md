PolicyEngine's Policy Library is at pilot-ready stage with operational proof of concept. We have successfully deployed production repositories for North Carolina (us-nc-sources on GitHub) and established a working integration with the Atlanta Federal Reserve's Policy Rules Database, demonstrating technical feasibility and government collaboration capability.

Our existing PolicyEngine infrastructure currently serves 72,000 households annually through our microsimulation platform, providing a robust foundation for rapid scaling. Our monitoring system coupled with Claude and GPT-4 analysis has been tested on multiple state websites, achieving high accuracy in document identification, change detection, and clarity measurement. Our Git-based version control system with Large File Storage is proven at scale through our existing repositories managing thousands of policy parameters.

Key technical components are operational: automated monitoring scripts detect document changes weekly, human review workflows via GitHub Pull Requests ensure accuracy, and our RESTful API prototype successfully serves documents with permanent source IDs. Our interactive mockup at policyengine.github.io/policy-library demonstrates the user experience. Partner testing validates market readiness. MyFriendBen has integrated our prototype, reporting significant reduction in link maintenance time. Benefit Navigator's pilot implementation confirms API stability and performance.

Our team brings proven expertise. CEO Max Ghenis previously led data science at Google and founded PolicyEngine. CTO Nikhil Woodruff architected our microsimulation models serving millions. ML Engineer Pavel Makarchuk brings specialized AI and ML experience from successful startups. With PBIF support, we're positioned to scale from pilot to nationwide coverage within 12 months, achieving our target of 100,000 plus archived documents across all 50 states.
