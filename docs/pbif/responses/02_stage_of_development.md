PolicyEngine Atlas builds on proven infrastructure at pilot-ready stage. Our document collection pilot with the Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity demonstrates the accessible component. PolicyEngine's rules engine helping 100,000+ Americans proves the computable component. The Clarity Index prototype shows how we'll make policies clear. Together, these create cross-cutting infrastructure ready for nationwide deployment.

Our existing PolicyEngine infrastructure serves 72,000 households annually through our microsimulation platform, providing robust foundation for rapid scaling. Our monitoring system coupled with Claude and GPT-4 analysis has been tested on multiple state websites, achieving high accuracy in document identification, change detection, and clarity measurement. Our Git-based version control system with Large File Storage is proven at scale through our existing repositories managing thousands of policy parameters.

Key technical components are operational: automated monitoring scripts detect document changes weekly, human review workflows via GitHub Pull Requests ensure accuracy, and our RESTful API prototype successfully serves documents with permanent source IDs. Our interactive mockup at policyengine.github.io/policy-library demonstrates the user experience. Partner testing validates market readiness. MyFriendBen has integrated our prototype, reporting significant reduction in link maintenance time. Benefit Navigator's pilot implementation confirms API stability and performance.

Our team brings proven expertise. CEO Max Ghenis previously led data science at Google and founded PolicyEngine. CTO Nikhil Woodruff architected our microsimulation models serving millions. ML Engineer Pavel Makarchuk brings specialized AI experience from successful startups. With PBIF support, we're positioned to scale from pilot to nationwide coverage within 12 months, achieving 100,000+ archived documents across all states.
