Our stakeholder engagement strategy builds on strong existing partnerships while systematically expanding to serve the entire benefits ecosystem. We secured letters of support from leading research institutions including Georgetown's Better Government Lab, Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Urban Institute, each committing to contribute specialized document collections and validate our approach. Direct service organizations like Benefit Kitchen, MyFriendBen, and SnapScreener confirmed the critical need for this infrastructure and committed to early adoption.

Engagement happens through multiple channels tailored to each stakeholder group. Our bounty program incentivizes experts from trusted organizations like Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity to vet AI contributions and submit their own documents, ensuring comprehensive coverage across the rules-as-code ecosystem. Direct service organizations participate in monthly user groups sharing implementation challenges. Government partners like the Atlanta Federal Reserve integrate our system into their Policy Rules Database. Community advocates contribute through our open GitHub process, ensuring affected populations have direct input.

Our partner network creates network effects that accelerate adoption. Each integrated organization becomes an advocate, sharing success stories that attract similar organizations. MyFriendBen's significant reduction in maintenance time provides compelling evidence for other direct service providers. Academic publications from university partners lend credibility that opens doors with government agencies. Technical documentation and open source code enable self-service adoption without requiring direct involvement.

Continuous feedback loops ensure we remain responsive to user needs through regular surveys, usage analytics, feature request tracking, and an active community forum where users help each other succeed.
