The Policy Library creates permanent, AI-powered archives of safety net program documents across federal, state, and DC jurisdictions, replacing fragile direct links with stable API endpoints that never break. Our solution employs Claude and GPT-4 crawlers to monitor agency websites weekly, capturing documents before they disappear, while human reviewers verify accuracy through GitHub workflows ensuring reliability and transparency.

Our primary beneficiaries span multiple stakeholder groups, starting with tens of thousands of families annually who will access benefits more reliably through our partner tools. When policy documents remain permanently available, families can verify their eligibility, appeal wrongful denials, and understand their rights without encountering the broken links that currently prevent them from accessing critical information. Our LLM benchmark demonstrates substantial accuracy improvement in benefit calculations when AI tools have access to these authoritative sources.

Direct service organizations including MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, SnapScreener, and hundreds of nonprofits will collectively save thousands of hours yearly that they currently waste on system maintenance. These organizations report spending substantial time monthly just updating broken links, time that could be spent serving clients. Our stable API eliminates this burden entirely, allowing them to focus on their core mission of helping families navigate the benefits system.

The research and AI community gains reliable training data enabling accurate benefit tools. Our unique PolicyEngine rules engine integration creates a knowledge graph revealing hidden connectionsâ€”like SNAP's 200% FPL in NC enabling Lifeline. This helps families discover benefits through categorical eligibility pathways that document search alone never reveals.
