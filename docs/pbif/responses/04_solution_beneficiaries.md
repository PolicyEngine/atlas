PolicyEngine Atlas transforms America's fragmented safety net into an integrated system by connecting preserved documents to encoded rules, revealing hidden eligibility pathways, and enabling cross-jurisdiction learning through our Clarity Index. We monitor agency websites using Claude/GPT-4, with experts from Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity validating findings through our bounty program, creating infrastructure making every rules engine accurate and every caseworker effective.

Rules-as-code developers become force multipliers reaching millions through accurate calculations. PolicyEngine (72,000 households), MyFriendBen (3,500 users), Benefit Navigator (500+ caseworkers) need authoritative sources proving accuracy. Our stable APIs with permanent IDs replace broken links, while our knowledge graph reveals categorical eligibility chains invisible to traditional search. When tools cite exact regulatory sources, governments trust them officially.

Caseworkers gain superpowers navigating complexity. Instead of searching scattered PDFs, they discover North Carolina families at 185% FPL qualify for Lifeline through TANFâ†’SNAP pathways our system reveals. The Clarity Index shows which states write clearest policies, reducing interpretation errors. Workers help families rather than hunt documents, while our MCP server enables benefit queries through Claude with guaranteed accuracy.

Government agencies finally learn from peers. When Montana's clearer SNAP rules reduce errors, our Clarity Index alerts other states. Agencies see exactly which policy language correlates with lower error rates across jurisdictions. This transforms isolated experiments into systematic improvement, potentially saving billions in administrative costs while improving access for millions currently missing qualifying benefits.
