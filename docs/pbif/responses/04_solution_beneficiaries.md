PolicyEngine Atlas makes policies accessible, clear, and computable—transforming America's fragmented safety net into an integrated system. We retrieve, store, update, and distribute thousands of documents through web, API, and MCP server. But we transcend storage: our rules engine connects documents semantically, revealing hidden eligibility pathways. The Clarity Index scores each document objectively, enabling systematic improvement. This cross-cutting infrastructure benefits everyone working to deliver benefits effectively.

Rules-as-code developers gain authoritative sources to prove accuracy. PolicyEngine helps over 100,000 Americans; MyFriendBen serves 3,500 monthly; Benefit Navigator supports 500+ caseworkers. All need computable policies they can cite. Our semantic layer reveals categorical eligibility chains—TANF→SNAP→Lifeline—invisible in traditional search. When tools reference exact regulatory text, governments trust them for official use.

Civil society organizations access authoritative sources instantly through our infrastructure. No more searching across fragmented agency websites or questioning document validity. Caseworkers discover eligibility pathways through semantic connections. The Clarity Index shows which language works, reducing interpretation errors. Our MCP server enables AI assistants to query benefits with authoritative sources, preventing hallucination.

Government agencies learn systematically from successful peers. The Clarity Index reveals which policy language correlates with lower error rates across jurisdictions. Agencies see Montana's simplified asset rules reducing errors and adopt proven approaches. Strategic subgrants to organizations with direct government ties ensure real implementation. This transforms isolated experiments into systematic improvement, saving billions while expanding access.
