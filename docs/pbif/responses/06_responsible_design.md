PolicyEngine Atlas implements comprehensive safeguards ensuring ethical, secure, and equitable access to public benefit documentation while protecting privacy and preventing misuse.

Privacy protection begins with archiving only publicly available government documents, never collecting personal data. System architecture actively prevents PII storage even if accidentally encountered. We maintain no user tracking beyond basic API metrics, ensuring complete privacy while complying with GDPR, CCPA, and government standards through regular security audits.

Equity considerations shape every design decision. Comprehensive coverage of all states prevents geographic bias. Spanish language support in Year 2 addresses linguistic barriers. Free API access for nonprofits ensures cost never prevents usage. Simplified interfaces accommodate limited technical expertise. Community partnerships ensure diverse perspectives guide development.

AI safety protocols require human review before any document publication. Clear source labeling and extraction dates provide transparency. Version control maintains complete audit trails. Open source code enables community verification and corrections. Regular benchmarking against manual verification ensures sustained accuracy.

Misuse prevention balances openness with security. Rate limiting prevents abuse without impeding legitimate use. Terms explicitly prohibit fraud or harassment. Since documents are already public, we improve legitimate access without enabling new risks. Continuous monitoring identifies suspicious patterns while maintaining agency communication channels.

Transparency mechanisms ensure accountability through our public GitHub repository, monthly performance reports, community advisory board including affected populations, clear feedback channels for corrections, and regular third-party audits validating our practices meet highest ethical standards.
