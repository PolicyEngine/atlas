We commit to radical transparency and knowledge sharing, ensuring all learnings benefit the entire ecosystem and can be replicated globally.

Our open source approach publishes all code on GitHub under MIT license in real-time, with comprehensive documentation and Docker containers enabling straightforward deployment anywhere. Weekly development updates keep the community informed while welcoming contributions that strengthen the system. This collaborative environment accelerates innovation beyond what any single organization could achieve.

Research publications share methodological innovations systematically. Month 6 brings our LLM accuracy benchmark methodology paper with Stanford HAI. Month 9 delivers a best practices whitepaper on policy document preservation. Month 12 features partner case studies with quantified impacts. Month 18 sees peer-reviewed publication on AI-powered government documentation. Month 24 concludes with Georgetown University's comprehensive impact evaluation.

Conference presentations reach key audiences: Code for America Summit for civic technologists, NACo Annual Conference for county officials, APHSA for human services professionals, and AI for Good Summit for responsible AI practitioners. Each venue spreads learnings to distinct communities that can implement or support the Policy Library.

Community support infrastructure includes monthly office hours for troubleshooting, Discord for peer support, quarterly webinars on new features, and an annual virtual summit starting Year 2. Educational resources span video tutorials, template code in multiple languages, university course materials, and policy brief templates for advocates.

Impact amplification leverages PolicyEngine's media channels, partner co-marketing, foundation networks, and government associations to ensure learnings reach everyone working to improve benefit access, creating lasting change beyond our direct implementations.
