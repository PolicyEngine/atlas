America's fragmented safety net costs $10.5 billion in SNAP errors alone while millions miss qualifying benefits. Beyond disappearing documents, we lack infrastructure connecting policy to practice, revealing program interactions, and enabling cross-jurisdiction learning. This systemic failure creates cascading crises.

Rules engines cannot prove accuracy without authoritative sources. PolicyEngine serves 72,000 households but struggles when documents vanish overnight. MyFriendBen wastes 40+ hours monthly fixing broken references. Benefit Navigator's 500 caseworkers lose credibility when calculations lack citations. Without stable infrastructure, these tools cannot earn government trust.

Hidden eligibility pathways block benefit access. North Carolina families at 185% FPL qualify for Lifeline through TANF→SNAP categorical eligibility, but traditional search never reveals this. These interactions exist everywhere—LIHEAP enabling weatherization, SSI triggering Medicaid, SNAP qualifying school lunches—yet caseworkers cannot discover them. Families miss benefits they deserve because connections stay buried.

Agencies cannot learn from peers. When Montana reduces errors through clearer asset language, California never knows. When Oregon's simplified forms cut processing time, Texas continues struggling. States repeat expensive mistakes because no infrastructure enables systematic comparison. The Clarity Index changes this.

AI amplifies failures exponentially. Large language models hallucinate benefit rules without authoritative sources, spreading misinformation affecting real decisions about healthcare, housing, employment. As governments adopt AI, confusion multiplies precisely when accuracy matters most for vulnerable families.
