America's safety net suffers from a critical infrastructure failure: policy documents that determine benefit eligibility disappear constantly. Many benefit program URLs from just a few years ago are now completely dead. When CaseText shut down, thousands of legal references vanished overnight. State agencies regularly reorganize websites, breaking every link that benefit calculators, case workers, and families depend on.

This creates cascading failures throughout the benefits ecosystem. Families cannot verify their eligibility when documentation disappears, leading to wrongful denials and lost benefits. Case workers at organizations like MyFriendBen waste over 40 hours monthly updating broken links instead of helping clients. AI tools like ChatGPT provide dangerously incorrect benefit information without access to authoritative sources, potentially costing families thousands in unclaimed benefits.

The root cause is architectural: no standardized system exists for preserving policy documents. Agencies lack resources for permanent archives. Commercial providers can disappear without warning. No version control tracks policy changes over time. Current solutions are band-aidsâ€”each organization maintains partial, duplicative collections that quickly become outdated.

The human cost is staggering. Georgetown University researchers found that historical policy analysis is nearly impossible due to missing documents. The Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database struggles to maintain accuracy without reliable sources. Most critically, vulnerable families lose access to food, healthcare, and housing assistance because the rules governing these programs have literally disappeared from the internet, creating an invisible barrier to the benefits they desperately need and legally deserve.
