Policies aren't accessible, clear, or computable—blocking effective benefit delivery nationwide. Documents disappear from agency websites, and finding authoritative sources requires navigating fragmented systems. Language varies wildly between jurisdictions, making consistent interpretation impossible. Without computational structure, rules engines can't prove accuracy, and AI tools hallucinate benefits. This infrastructure failure costs billions in errors while millions miss qualifying benefits.

Rules-as-code developers cannot prove their calculations are correct without authoritative sources. PolicyEngine helps over 100,000 Americans but cannot cite specific regulatory text. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator lack the infrastructure to verify their eligibility determinations. Without computable policies linked to sources, these tools cannot earn government trust or scale effectively.

Hidden eligibility pathways remain buried without semantic connections. Categorical eligibility chains—TANF enabling SNAP, SNAP qualifying Lifeline—exist across programs but stay invisible in traditional search. LIHEAP enables weatherization, SSI triggers Medicaid, SNAP qualifies school lunches. Yet caseworkers cannot discover these connections. Families miss benefits because policies aren't computationally linked.

Unclear language drives administrative burden. GAO calls regulations "inherently error-prone" when complex. Research proves simplification's impact equals expanding eligibility, yet agencies cannot learn which language works. States repeat expensive mistakes because no infrastructure enables systematic comparison across jurisdictions. Without objective clarity metrics, improvement remains guesswork.

As governments adopt AI, inaccessible policies amplify failures exponentially. Large language models require authoritative sources to avoid hallucinating benefit rules. Misinformation spreads affecting real decisions about healthcare, housing, employment—precisely when accuracy matters most for vulnerable families needing assistance.
