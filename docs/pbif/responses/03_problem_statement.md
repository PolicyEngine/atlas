America's fragmented safety net suffers from 10.93% SNAP error rates (FY2024) while millions miss qualifying benefits. This represents massive regression from the 3.2% record-low achieved in FY2013 through simplification. GAO confirms policy complexity drives errors—calling regulations "inherently error-prone." We lack infrastructure connecting policy to practice, revealing program interactions, and enabling cross-jurisdiction learning.

Rules engines cannot prove accuracy without authoritative sources. PolicyEngine serves 72,000 households but struggles when documents vanish overnight. MyFriendBen wastes 40+ hours monthly fixing broken references. Benefit Navigator's 500 caseworkers lose credibility when calculations lack citations. Without stable infrastructure, these tools cannot earn government trust.

Hidden eligibility pathways block benefit access. North Carolina families at 185% FPL qualify for Lifeline through TANF→SNAP categorical eligibility, but traditional search never reveals this. These interactions exist everywhere—LIHEAP enabling weatherization, SSI triggering Medicaid, SNAP qualifying school lunches—yet caseworkers cannot discover them. Families miss benefits they deserve because connections stay buried.

Agencies cannot learn from peers. Research shows every 1-point clarity improvement correlates with 0.5-1% fewer errors, yet states repeat expensive mistakes because no infrastructure enables systematic comparison. Administrative burden studies prove simplification impact equals expanding eligibility. The Clarity Index quantifies this for the first time.

AI amplifies failures exponentially. Large language models hallucinate benefit rules without authoritative sources, spreading misinformation affecting real decisions about healthcare, housing, employment. As governments adopt AI, confusion multiplies precisely when accuracy matters most for vulnerable families.
