PolicyEngine Atlas makes policies accessible, clear, and computable through comprehensive infrastructure. Our system monitors jurisdiction websites weekly for statutes, regulations, memos, and forms. Claude and GPT-4 analyze captured documents, extracting structure and identifying relationships. The Clarity Index scores each document's language objectively, revealing which phrasing drives administrative burden. This creates the foundation for systematic improvement across jurisdictions.

Documents become accessible through multiple preservation methods. PDFs and text go into Git repositories with Large File Storage, creating immutable version history. Dynamic web content uses Browsertrix for WARC-format archives. Our bounty program engages experts from partner organizations to validate AI findings and contribute documents. Every document receives a permanent ID that survives website reorganizations, ensuring civil society organizations never lose critical references.

Clarity emerges through AI-human collaboration. The Clarity Index combines automated analysis with expert validation, measuring how consistently policy language translates to implementation. We identify specific passages causing interpretation errors, providing actionable feedback to agencies. Strategic subgrants to organizations with government relationships ensure findings reach policymakers who can implement improvements.

Computability comes from semantic connections with PolicyEngine's rules engine. Our parameters and logic link to source documents, creating a knowledge graph revealing hidden eligibility pathways. When users query benefits, we trace through categorical eligibility chainsâ€”TANF enabling SNAP, SNAP qualifying Lifeline. This computational structure, impossible with traditional search, transforms how caseworkers navigate complex programs and helps families discover all qualifying benefits.
