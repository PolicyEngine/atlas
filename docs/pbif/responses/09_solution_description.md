The Policy Library solves the infrastructure problem of disappearing policy documents. Our architecture monitors jurisdiction websites weekly for statutes, regulations, memos, and forms. When changes are detected, Claude and GPT-4 analyze documents. Our open-source Clarity Index, trained on expert-flagged examples, measures how consistently AIs translate policy to codeâ€”mirroring caseworker interpretation. This identifies ambiguity driving SNAP QC errors.

Once identified, we capture documents using multiple preservation methods. PDFs and text documents go into Git repositories with Large File Storage, creating immutable version history. Dynamic web content uses Browsertrix for WARC-format archives preserving the complete browsing experience. Our bounty program incentivizes experts from Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity to vet AI contributions and submit documents, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

The technical infrastructure leverages proven, scalable technologies. Git provides distributed version control that prevents single points of failure. OpenSearch enables full-text search across millions of documents. Our RESTful API serves documents through permanent source IDs that never change, even when government websites reorganize. This combination of AI intelligence, human verification, and robust infrastructure creates a system that is both highly automated and exceptionally reliable.

Integration with PolicyEngine's rules engine creates unprecedented search. When users query "Lifeline eligibility," we trace encoded rules revealing NC's 200% FPL SNAP creates categorical eligibility for Lifeline. This knowledge graph, impossible with RAG alone, helps caseworkers understand program interactions and families discover hidden eligibility pathways.
