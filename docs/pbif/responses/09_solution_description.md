The Policy Library employs AI technology to solve the infrastructure problem of disappearing policy documents. Our architecture monitors jurisdiction websites weekly for statutes, regulations, memos, and forms. When changes are detected, Claude and GPT-4 analyze documents and distinguish updates. Our open-source Clarity Index, trained on expert-flagged examples, measures how consistently AIs translate policy to codeâ€”mirroring caseworker interpretation. This identifies ambiguity driving SNAP QC errors.

Once documents are identified, our system captures them using multiple preservation methods. For standard PDFs and text documents, we store them in Git repositories with Large File Storage, creating an immutable version history. For dynamic web content, we employ Browsertrix to create WARC-format archives that preserve the complete browsing experience. Our bounty program incentivizes experts from trusted organizations like Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity to vet AI contributions and submit their own documents, ensuring comprehensive coverage across the rules-as-code ecosystem.

The technical infrastructure leverages proven, scalable technologies. Git provides distributed version control that prevents single points of failure. OpenSearch enables full-text search across millions of documents. Our RESTful API serves documents through permanent source IDs that never change, even when government websites reorganize. This combination of AI intelligence, human verification, and robust infrastructure creates a system that is both highly automated and exceptionally reliable.

Integration with PolicyEngine's rules engine demonstrates value by combining archived documents with encoded policy, helping governments improve clarity. Organizations access documents through API calls, replacing fragile links with stable endpoints. The bounty program enables organizations to audit, contribute, or self-host.
