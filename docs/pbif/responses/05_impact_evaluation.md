Our evaluation strategy combines quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and independent validation to measure impact across three critical dimensions of document preservation, user outcomes, and system improvements. We will track progress from a baseline of 500 documents to 50,000 in Year 1 and 100,000 by Year 2, while monitoring API usage patterns that we expect to reach one million calls monthly by grant end.

Partner integration growth from our current three organizations to dozens by Year 2 will demonstrate ecosystem adoption, while the number of people served through these partner tools will expand to tens of thousands annually. Through systematic partner surveys, we will document the thousands of hours saved annually by organizations no longer maintaining broken links, and our standardized benchmark will validate substantial improvement in LLM accuracy when AI tools access our authoritative sources.

Qualitative assessment through quarterly partner interviews captures workflow improvements and user stories. We'll develop case studies of families discovering categorical eligibility through rules engine connections—like NC households accessing Lifeline through SNAP's 200% FPL threshold. Developer feedback on our knowledge graph API, revealing hidden program interactions impossible to find through document search alone, guides continuous improvement.

Independent evaluation provides crucial third-party validation, with Georgetown University conducting our Year 2 impact assessment, Vanderbilt's Prenatal-to-3 Center evaluating child welfare improvements, and Urban Institute analyzing cost-effectiveness versus current approaches. We'll measure Clarity Index correlation with error rates—research shows each 1-point improvement yields 0.5-1% fewer errors, potentially saving states millions annually based on GAO-documented patterns.
