The Policy Library leverages modern cloud infrastructure designed for scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency. Our technical stack combines proven technologies that handle millions of documents while minimizing operational complexity. Cloud hosting through AWS or Google Cloud provides auto-scaling compute resources that expand during crawling operations and contract during quiet periods, optimizing costs while ensuring performance.

Storage architecture employs a tiered approach matching access patterns to appropriate technologies. Hot storage using Git with Large File Storage maintains frequently accessed current documents with instant retrieval. Warm storage in object stores like S3 holds historical versions and less-accessed documents at lower cost. Cold storage archives ensure permanent preservation of all documents even if primary systems fail. This tiered approach reduces costs while maintaining rapid access to the documents users need most.

Our API infrastructure uses serverless functions that scale automatically with demand, eliminating the need for dedicated servers while ensuring consistent sub-second response times. Content delivery networks cache frequently requested documents at edge locations, reducing latency for users nationwide. OpenSearch provides full-text search capabilities across millions of documents, with intelligent indexing that understands policy terminology and context.

Development infrastructure supports rapid iteration while maintaining quality. Continuous integration pipelines automatically test code changes, ensuring new features don't break existing functionality. Staging environments enable partner testing before production deployment. Monitoring systems track performance metrics, alert on anomalies, and provide insights for optimization. This robust infrastructure foundation enables us to serve hundreds of partner organizations reliably while keeping operational costs manageable.
