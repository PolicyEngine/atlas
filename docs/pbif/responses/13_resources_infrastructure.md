The Policy Library leverages modern cloud infrastructure designed for scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency. Our technical stack combines proven technologies that handle millions of documents while minimizing operational complexity. Cloud hosting through AWS or Google Cloud provides auto-scaling compute resources that expand during crawling operations and contract during quiet periods, optimizing costs while ensuring performance.

Storage architecture employs a tiered approach matching access patterns to appropriate technologies. Hot storage using Git with Large File Storage maintains frequently accessed current documents with instant retrieval. Warm storage in object stores like S3 holds historical versions and less-accessed documents at lower cost. Cold storage archives ensure permanent preservation of all documents even if primary systems fail. This tiered approach reduces costs while maintaining rapid access to the documents users need most.

Our API uniquely combines document search with PolicyEngine's rules engine metadata. When searching "Lifeline eligibility," we trace encoded rules revealing NC's 200% FPL SNAP creates categorical eligibility. This knowledge graph surfaces hidden program connections impossible to find through traditional search or RAG alone, helping families discover unknown benefit eligibility.

Development infrastructure supports rapid iteration while maintaining quality. Continuous integration pipelines automatically test code changes, ensuring new features don't break existing functionality. Staging environments enable partner testing before production deployment. Monitoring systems track performance metrics, alert on anomalies, and provide insights for optimization. This robust infrastructure foundation enables us to serve hundreds of partner organizations reliably while keeping operational costs manageable.
