Policies must be accessible, clear, and computational to deliver benefits effectively. As the leading open-source tax-benefit rules engine—helping over 100,000 Americans through API customers like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator, serving Congress, UK government, and top universities, funded by evidence-oriented donors like Arnold Ventures and NSF—PolicyEngine has pursued these qualities for years. PolicyEngine Atlas takes the next step as cross-cutting infrastructure starting from the source: policy documents.

We'll retrieve, store, update, and distribute thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals through a web app, API, and MCP server. Atlas transcends storage by leveraging PolicyEngine's rules engine to connect documents at the semantic layer. Our policy parameters and logic, corroborated by source documents, reveal hidden eligibility pathways across programs and jurisdictions. This infrastructure directly benefits the growing rules-as-code community while enabling AI tools to cite authoritative sources instead of hallucinating benefits.

Building on our pilot with the Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity, we'll demonstrate infrastructure that fixes errors at the root: a Clarity Index scoring each document, uniting AI and human experts to help governments identify which policy language drives administrative burden. With 44 states failing SNAP error thresholds, systematic clarity improvements could save billions while expanding access.

PolicyEngine Atlas arms everyone—applicants, caseworkers, researchers, policymakers—with foundational, vetted sources of truth. This investment creates essential infrastructure for the next generation of benefit delivery tools, making America's fragmented safety net finally work as an integrated system through accessible, clear, and computational policy.
