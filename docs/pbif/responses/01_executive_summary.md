Policies must be accessible, clear, and computable to deliver benefits effectively. As the leading open-source rules engine—helping over 100,000 Americans through API customers like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator, serving Congress, UK government, and top universities, funded by Arnold Ventures and NSF—PolicyEngine has pursued these qualities for years. PolicyEngine Atlas takes the next step as cross-cutting infrastructure starting from the source: policy documents.

We'll retrieve, store, update, and distribute thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals through a web app, API, and MCP server, building on our document collection pilot with the Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity. But Atlas transcends storage—we'll leverage PolicyEngine's rules engine to connect documents at the semantic layer. Our policy parameters and logic, corroborated by source documents, reveal hidden eligibility pathways across programs and jurisdictions. This infrastructure benefits the growing rules-as-code community while enabling AI tools to cite authoritative sources.

Finally, we'll demonstrate this infrastructure's utility for addressing a core problem: error rates. By combining human expertise, rules-as-code, and AI, we'll assign each document a Clarity Index showing which policy language drives administrative burden and costly errors. Through strategic subgrants to organizations with direct government ties, we'll ensure the Atlas and Clarity Index deliver real change and promote open government.

PolicyEngine Atlas arms everyone—applicants, caseworkers, researchers, policymakers—with foundational, vetted sources of truth. This investment creates essential infrastructure for the next generation of benefit delivery tools, making America's fragmented safety net finally work as an integrated system through accessible, clear, and computable policy.
