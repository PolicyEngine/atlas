Policy documents are the foundation of America's safety net—determining who gets help and how. Yet this critical infrastructure remains fragmented, ambiguous, and disconnected from modern benefit delivery tools. Without accessible, clear, and computable policies, the entire ecosystem cannot function. As the leading open-source rules engine helping over 100,000 Americans through partners like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator—PolicyEngine has pursued these qualities for years, with support from Arnold Ventures and NSF. PolicyEngine Atlas builds this foundational layer.

We'll retrieve, store, update, and distribute thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals through web, API, and MCP server, building on our pilot with Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity. But Atlas transcends storage—we'll leverage PolicyEngine's rules engine to connect documents at the semantic layer. Our policy parameters and logic, corroborated by source documents, reveal hidden eligibility pathways across programs and jurisdictions. This infrastructure benefits the growing rules-as-code community while enabling AI tools to cite authoritative sources.

Finally, we'll demonstrate addressing error rates. By combining human expertise, rules-as-code, and AI, we'll assign each document a Clarity Index showing which policy language drives administrative burden and costly errors. Through strategic subgrants to organizations with direct government ties, we'll ensure the Atlas and Clarity Index deliver real change and promote open government.

PolicyEngine Atlas arms everyone—applicants, caseworkers, researchers, policymakers—with foundational, vetted sources of truth. This investment creates essential infrastructure for the next generation of benefit delivery tools, making America's fragmented safety net finally work as an integrated system through accessible, clear, and computable policy.
