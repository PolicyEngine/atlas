Policy documents are the foundation of America's safety net—determining who gets help and how. Yet this critical infrastructure remains fragmented, ambiguous, and disconnected from modern benefit delivery tools. The entire ecosystem of rules engines, AI assistants, and benefit navigators depends on policies being accessible, clear, and computable. PolicyEngine Atlas provides this essential infrastructure.

We'll create comprehensive infrastructure that retrieves, stores, and distributes thousands of documents through web, API, and MCP server—building on our pilot with Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity. Documents get permanent IDs and version tracking, making them accessible. Our rules engine connects them semantically, revealing hidden eligibility pathways like TANF→SNAP→Lifeline chains, making them computable. This enables every tool in the ecosystem—from our own serving 100,000+ Americans to partners MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator—to cite authoritative sources.

The Clarity Index tackles the administrative burden crisis directly. By analyzing every document with AI and human experts, we'll identify which specific policy language correlates with error rates and interpretation problems. Strategic subgrants to organizations with government ties ensure agencies learn from successful peers—transforming isolated improvements into systematic reform.

This investment doesn't just preserve documents; it creates the infrastructure making fragmented systems work as one. Rules-as-code developers gain trustworthy sources. Caseworkers discover eligibility pathways. Agencies reduce errors through clearer language. PolicyEngine Atlas delivers the accessible, clear, and computable policies that effective benefit delivery requires.
