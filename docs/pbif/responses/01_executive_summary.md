PolicyEngine seeks $498,000 to build the Policy Library, an AI-powered infrastructure creating permanent, machine-readable archives of safety net program rules across all U.S. jurisdictions. Our solution addresses the critical problem of disappearing policy documentsâ€”18% of benefit program URLs from 2019 are now dead, causing families to lose benefits and organizations to waste thousands of hours maintaining broken systems.

Using Claude and GPT-4 powered crawlers, we monitor 50+ jurisdictions weekly, capturing statutes, regulations, and forms before they vanish. Human reviewers verify accuracy through GitHub pull requests, ensuring reliability. We serve everything through a stable API with permanent source IDs that never break, replacing the fragile direct links that current tools depend on.

The Policy Library will directly benefit three groups: families accessing benefits (reaching 160,000+ annually through partner tools), direct service organizations like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator (saving 10,000+ hours yearly on maintenance), and AI developers building benefit tools (providing authoritative sources to prevent hallucination).

Our pilot with North Carolina and the Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database proves the concept. With PolicyEngine's existing infrastructure serving 72,000 households annually, we're positioned to scale rapidly. Year one will archive 100,000+ documents across all states, integrate with major benefit access tools, and establish the national standard for policy preservation.

This investment will create lasting infrastructure that makes America's safety net more accessible, accurate, and equitable, while advancing the frontier of AI-powered government services through reliable, permanent source documentation.
