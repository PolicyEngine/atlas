Policies must be accessible, clear, and computational to deliver benefits effectively. As the leading open-source tax-benefit rules engine—helping over 100,000 Americans through API customers like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator, serving Congress, UK government, and top universities, funded by evidence-oriented donors like Arnold Ventures and NSF—PolicyEngine has pursued these qualities for years. PolicyEngine Atlas takes the next step as cross-cutting infrastructure starting from the source: policy documents.

We'll retrieve, store, update, and distribute thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals through a web app, API, and MCP server. But Atlas transcends storage: it leverages PolicyEngine's rules engine to connect documents at the semantic layer. Our policy parameters and logic, corroborated by source documents, reveal hidden networks of clauses across documents, agencies, and jurisdictions—demystifying eligibility for users. North Carolina families discover Lifeline access through TANF→SNAP pathways invisible in traditional search.

Because this infrastructure is essential for next-generation AI-driven government tools, we'll demonstrate fixing errors at the root: building a Clarity Index for each document, uniting AI and human experts to help governments adopt proven techniques. SNAP achieved 3.2% error rates in FY2013 through simplification but regressed to 10.93% by FY2024—proving the urgent need for systematic clarity improvements.

PolicyEngine Atlas unlocks benefits efficiently by arming everyone—applicants, caseworkers, researchers, policymakers—with foundational, vetted sources of truth. Our North Carolina pilot with Atlanta Fed validates the approach. This investment doesn't just preserve documents; it creates infrastructure making America's fragmented safety net finally work as an integrated system.
