America's safety net depends on policy documents—they determine who gets help and how. Yet without accessible, clear, and computable policies, the entire ecosystem of benefit delivery tools cannot function effectively. As the leading open-source rules engine helping over 100,000 Americans through partners like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator, PolicyEngine has pursued these qualities for years. PolicyEngine Atlas takes the next step as cross-cutting infrastructure, starting from the source.

We'll retrieve, store, update, and distribute thousands of statutes, regulations, and manuals through web, API, and MCP server, building on our document collection pilot with the Atlanta Fed and Georgia Center for Opportunity. But Atlas transcends storage—we'll leverage PolicyEngine's rules engine to connect documents at the semantic layer. Our policy parameters and logic, corroborated by source documents, reveal hidden eligibility pathways across programs and jurisdictions. This infrastructure benefits the growing rules-as-code community while enabling AI tools to cite authoritative sources.

The Clarity Index addresses administrative burden at its root. By combining human expertise, rules-as-code, and AI, we'll score each document to identify which policy language correlates with error rates and interpretation problems. Strategic subgrants to organizations with government ties ensure agencies learn from successful peers—transforming isolated improvements into systematic reform.

PolicyEngine Atlas arms everyone—applicants, caseworkers, researchers, policymakers—with foundational, vetted sources of truth. This investment creates essential infrastructure for the next generation of benefit delivery tools, making America's fragmented safety net finally work as an integrated system through accessible, clear, and computable policy.
