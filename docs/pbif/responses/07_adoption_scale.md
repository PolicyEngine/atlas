Our adoption strategy leverages existing partnerships and proven demand to achieve nationwide scale within 12 months.

Immediate adoption begins with committed partners ready to integrate. MyFriendBen brings 3,500 monthly users in Colorado, Benefit Navigator provides Gates Foundation backing, and SnapScreener offers SNAP expertise. Federal Reserve Atlanta integration lends instant government credibility. Georgetown and Urban Institute adoption drives academic usage, creating scholarly validation that opens additional doors.

Accelerated growth occurs through organic referrals where satisfied users become advocates. Our open API enables self-service integration without bottlenecks. Conference presentations at Code for America Summit, NACo, and APHSA reach decision makers directly. Published case studies with documented 75 percent time savings and 24 percentage point accuracy improvements make the value proposition undeniable. Expansion to 40 states by month 9 creates network effects where coverage drives demand.

Scale achievement by month 12 establishes us as indispensable infrastructure. Complete coverage of 50 states plus federal programs provides unmatched comprehensiveness. Integration with 30 organizations creates ecosystem lock-in. Government partnerships formalize through procurement processes. Publication of our LLM benchmark drives AI developer adoption rapidly.

Built-in scaling mechanisms ensure sustainable growth. Serverless architecture handles demand spikes automatically. Crowdsourced corrections reduce per-document costs. API-first distribution enables unlimited integrations. Our free nonprofit tier removes financial barriers while documented ROI justifies paid tiers.

Critical mass strategy focuses on Colorado, North Carolina, and California first, proving viability across diverse political and programmatic contexts before nationwide expansion.
