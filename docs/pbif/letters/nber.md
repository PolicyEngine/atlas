Dear PBIF Review Committee,

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is pleased to support PolicyEngine's application for the Public Benefit Innovation Fund to develop the Policy Library. As the nation's leading nonprofit economic research organization, we understand the critical importance of maintaining comprehensive, accessible documentation of tax and benefit policies for research and analysis.

## Existing Collaboration with PolicyEngine

NBER and PolicyEngine have established a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for collaboration on tax microsimulation capabilities. Through this partnership:

- PolicyEngine is developing an open-source emulator of our TAXSIM tool, which has served the research community since the 1970s
- Our teams are working together on validation and integration to ensure continuity of service
- Daniel Feenberg, TAXSIM's architect, provides technical guidance to PolicyEngine's development team

This collaboration demonstrates PolicyEngine's technical capabilities and commitment to supporting the research community with high-quality, validated tools.

## Contribution to the Policy Library

Through our existing MOU and this new initiative, NBER will contribute:

- **Historical tax policy documentation** assembled through TAXSIM development since the 1970s
- **Federal tax forms and instructions** from 2018 to present, systematically collected for TAXSIM validation
- **State tax documentation** covering all 50 states plus DC, including forms, instructions, and tax tables
- **Legislative materials** tracking major tax law changes affecting low- and moderate-income families
- **Technical documentation** on tax-benefit interactions that affect safety net program participants

We estimate our contribution will include 2,000+ unique documents providing both current and historical coverage of tax policies affecting benefit recipients.

## Research Impact

The Policy Library addresses a critical infrastructure gap that hampers economic research:

1. **Reproducibility** - Permanent archives ensure research can be validated years after publication
2. **Efficiency** - Centralized access eliminates duplicated effort across research teams
3. **Accuracy** - Source documents reduce errors in policy modeling and analysis
4. **Innovation** - Comprehensive documentation enables new research questions

Our affiliated researchers frequently study the interaction between tax policy and safety net programs. The Policy Library will be invaluable for understanding how tax credits like the EITC and CTC interact with SNAP, Medicaid, and other benefits.

## Technical Validation

NBER commits to participating in the technical validation of the Policy Library, including:

- Testing API functionality for research use cases
- Validating document metadata and relationships
- Contributing to the LLM benchmarking experiments
- Sharing best practices from decades of maintaining TAXSIM

## Alignment with PBIF Goals

This project strongly aligns with PBIF's mission to reduce administrative burden through technology. Tax filing is often a gateway to benefit programs through the EITC and CTC. Better documentation of tax-benefit interactions will help families maximize their resources and help caseworkers provide more accurate guidance.

The AI-powered approach PolicyEngine proposes is particularly promising. Our experience with TAXSIM shows that maintaining policy documentation requires continuous effort. Intelligent automation can make this sustainable at scale.

We look forward to continuing our collaboration with PolicyEngine and contributing to this important infrastructure for America's safety net.

Sincerely,

James Poterba
