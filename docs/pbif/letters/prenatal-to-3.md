Dear PBIF Review Committee,

The Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center at Vanderbilt University supports PolicyEngine's application for the Public Benefit Innovation Fund to develop the Policy Library. As a research center dedicated to evidence-based policy solutions for infants, toddlers, and their families, we recognize the critical need for accessible, permanently archived policy documentation.

## Our Challenge

Our research frequently requires accessing state childcare subsidy policy manuals and other benefit program documents. We regularly encounter broken links and disappeared documents that hinder our ability to track policy evolution and provide accurate guidance to policymakers.

## Partnership Value

The Policy Library would solve this shared challenge by:
- Permanently archiving the documents we need for research
- Enabling us to track policy changes over time
- Providing reliable access to source materials for our analyses

We look forward to contributing documents from our research and testing the library's utility for academic work. This collaboration would complement our existing use of PolicyEngine's microsimulation tools.

We are excited to partner with PolicyEngine and other organizations to build this essential infrastructure for America's safety net programs.

Sincerely,

[Name]  
Director, Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center  
Vanderbilt University
