Dear PBIF Review Committee,

The Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center at Vanderbilt University enthusiastically supports PolicyEngine's application for the Public Benefit Innovation Fund to develop the Policy Library. As a research center dedicated to evidence-based policy solutions that improve outcomes for infants, toddlers, and their families, we recognize the critical importance of accessible, accurate policy documentation.

## Our Partnership with PolicyEngine

We have been active users of PolicyEngine's tax credit modeling capabilities since 2023, utilizing their open-source tools to analyze the impacts of Child Tax Credit expansions, Earned Income Tax Credit modifications, and state-level family tax policies. Their microsimulation models have enabled us to produce more accurate estimates of policy impacts on families with young children across all 50 states.

## Contribution to the Policy Library

We are committed to contributing our extensive research archive to seed the Policy Library with critical documents related to early childhood policies, including:

- State-by-state TANF implementation documents we've collected through our policy tracking
- Child care subsidy regulations and eligibility guidelines across jurisdictions
- WIC program materials and nutritional assistance documentation
- Medicaid/CHIP enrollment procedures for pregnant women and young children
- State tax credit documentation affecting families with young children

Our team has assembled these documents through years of research, and we're eager to ensure they're preserved and accessible to the broader community. We estimate we can contribute 500+ unique policy documents covering federal and state programs affecting prenatal-to-age-3 populations.

## Impact on Our Work

The Policy Library will transform our research capabilities by:

1. **Eliminating redundant effort** - We currently spend significant time re-discovering documents that disappear from state websites
2. **Enabling longitudinal analysis** - Permanent archives will allow us to track policy evolution over time
3. **Improving accuracy** - Direct access to source documents will reduce errors in our policy analyses
4. **Accelerating research** - Comprehensive search capabilities will speed our systematic reviews

## Commitment Without Compensation

While we are not requesting financial support from this grant, we commit to:

- Contributing our full document archive within the first 3 months
- Providing ongoing documents as we discover them through our research
- Participating in quarterly feedback sessions
- Testing and validating the system with our research team
- Sharing the Policy Library with our network of state policymakers and researchers

## Alignment with PBIF Priorities

This project directly supports PBIF's goal of reducing administrative burden in safety net programs. Our research consistently shows that policy complexity and documentation challenges create barriers for families with young children accessing benefits. The Policy Library will help caseworkers, families, and researchers navigate these complex systems more effectively.

We look forward to collaborating with PolicyEngine and other partners to build this essential infrastructure for America's safety net programs.

Sincerely,
