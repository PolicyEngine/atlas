<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I write in support of PolicyEngine’s application for a Public Benefit
Innovation Fund grant. I am pleased to collaborate with PolicyEngine on
their Policy Library project, an initiative to create a permanently
archived collection of safety net policy documents.</p>
<p>The lack of a comprehensive and open-source documentation of key
safety net policy and program rules hinders both research and service
delivery. Identifying and encoding these program parameters, however, is
massive undertaking. These rules vary widely across time and place, are
recorded in various sources, and are sometimes not publicly available.
The few research teams who have made the investment to collect this
information have understandably make their resulting directories
proprietary. The cost to access them can be prohibitive, hindering
research and often precluding frontline organizations from using them.
Through the Policy Library, PolicyEngine promises a definitive solution
to this problem.</p>
<p>I am currently partnering with PolicyEngine to measure how enrollment
in safety net programs such SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, WIC, SSI, and housing
assistance, and the structure of these programs plus tax policies,
affects recipients’ work incentives. Our project leverages unique access
to restricted use data on household income and program enrollment. We
will use PolicyEngine’s microsimulation tool to compute households’
benefit-inclusive effective marginal tax rates. This project is possible
thanks to PolicyEngine’s ongoing work to identify and encode detailed
rules for these programs over time and across many jurisdictions. This
project also demonstrates our investment in comprehensive policy
modeling infrastructure. As part of our collaboration, my team will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contribute policy documents from our research archives to help
seed the library</p></li>
<li><p>Test the platform for academic use cases, particularly
multi-program interaction analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Provide feedback to ensure the library serves researchers
studying participation gaps and benefit cliffs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Policy Library addresses critical challenges our researchers
face: policy documents frequently disappear from government websites,
making it impossible to conduct longitudinal analysis or verify
historical eligibility rules. Beyond our immediate needs for rules
encoding, permanent access to these documents will enable new research
approaches: using LLMs with authoritative policy context to analyze
participation gaps, documenting state-level implementation differences,
studying how policies evolve in response to economic conditions, and
preserving the full context of policy intent through implementation
guidance. The library promises to enhance our ability to study safety
net programs, questions around take-up and access, their long-term
benefits to recipients, and more.</p>
<p>I support this important infrastructure project and look forward to
collaborating with the team at PolicyEngine on its development.</p>
