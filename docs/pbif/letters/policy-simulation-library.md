Dear PBIF Review Committee,

The PSL Foundation (PSL-F) strongly endorses PolicyEngine's application for the Public Benefit Innovation Fund to develop the Policy Library. As the fiscal sponsor of PolicyEngine and steward of open-source policy modeling tools including Tax-Calculator, we recognize this project as essential infrastructure for the policy analysis community.

## Our Relationship with PolicyEngine

PolicyEngine operates under PSL-F's fiscal sponsorship, allowing them to pursue their mission of democratizing policy analysis while we handle administrative functions. This arrangement has proven highly successful, with PolicyEngine becoming one of our most active and impactful projects. Their work exemplifies our commitment to open-source, transparent, and validated policy modeling.

## The Tax-Calculator Connection

PSL-F maintains Tax-Calculator, the open-source federal tax microsimulation model originally developed at the American Enterprise Institute and now used by:

- Congressional Budget Office staff for distributional analysis
- Joint Committee on Taxation staff for revenue estimation validation
- Academic researchers at over 50 universities
- Think tanks across the political spectrum

Tax-Calculator processes millions of tax returns annually through various interfaces, but users consistently struggle with one challenge: accessing authoritative documentation of tax laws and regulations. The Policy Library directly addresses this gap.

## Technical Integration Opportunities

We envision deep integration between Tax-Calculator and the Policy Library:

1. **Automatic documentation linking** - Tax-Calculator parameters will reference specific Policy Library documents
2. **Validation workflows** - Source documents will validate our encoded tax rules
3. **Historical analysis** - Archived documents will enable accurate historical simulations
4. **Rules-as-code generation** - AI tools can generate Tax-Calculator JSON from policy documents

We commit to modifying Tax-Calculator to leverage the Policy Library API, demonstrating its value for rules-as-code projects nationwide.

## Contribution of Resources

PSL-F will contribute:

- **Tax documentation archive** - Federal tax forms, instructions, and publications from our validation datasets
- **State tax materials** - Documentation we've collected for state tax modeling initiatives  
- **Legislative tracking** - Materials from monitoring tax law changes since 2017
- **Technical expertise** - Our maintainers will help design the API for rules-as-code integration
- **Community connections** - We'll promote adoption across our network of 200+ contributors

## Impact on Open-Source Policy Modeling

The Policy Library addresses critical challenges in our community:

- **Broken links plague our documentation** - We regularly update dead URLs in Tax-Calculator
- **Reproducibility requires permanent archives** - Research from 5 years ago often can't be validated
- **Encoding errors stem from missing sources** - Direct document access will improve accuracy
- **International expansion needs infrastructure** - The Policy Library model can extend globally

## Commitment to PBIF Priorities

This project exemplifies using technology to improve safety net programs. Many benefit recipients interact with the tax system through EITC and CTC claims. Better documentation of these programs, and their interaction with traditional benefits, will reduce errors and improve take-up rates.

The open-source approach ensures maximum impact. Just as Tax-Calculator democratized tax analysis, the Policy Library will democratize access to policy documentation. This infrastructure will enable innovations we haven't yet imagined.

## Financial Stewardship

As PolicyEngine's fiscal sponsor, we attest to their responsible financial management and operational excellence. They have successfully managed multiple grants and contracts while maintaining lean operations. We are confident they will be excellent stewards of PBIF funds.

We enthusiastically support this application and look forward to integrating the Policy Library with our entire suite of open-source policy models.

Sincerely,

[Name]  
President, PSL Foundation
