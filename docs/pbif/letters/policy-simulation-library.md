Dear PBIF Review Committee,

The Policy Simulation Library (PSL) strongly endorses PolicyEngine's application for the Public Benefit Innovation Fund to develop the Policy Library. As a community of open-source policy modeling projects including Tax-Calculator, we recognize this project as essential infrastructure for the policy analysis community.

## Our Relationship with PolicyEngine

PolicyEngine is an active member of the PSL community, contributing open-source policy modeling tools that complement our existing projects. PolicyEngine exemplifies our community's commitment to open-source, transparent, and validated policy modeling. Their tools are used alongside Tax-Calculator and other PSL projects by researchers worldwide.

## The Tax-Calculator Connection

The PSL community maintains Tax-Calculator, the open-source federal tax microsimulation model originally developed at the American Enterprise Institute and now used by:

- Congressional Budget Office staff for distributional analysis
- Joint Committee on Taxation staff for revenue estimation validation
- Academic researchers at over 50 universities
- Think tanks across the political spectrum

Tax-Calculator processes millions of tax returns annually through various interfaces, but users consistently struggle with one challenge: accessing authoritative documentation of tax laws and regulations. The Policy Library directly addresses this gap.

## Technical Integration Opportunities

We envision deep integration between Tax-Calculator and the Policy Library:

1. **Automatic documentation linking** - Tax-Calculator parameters will reference specific Policy Library documents
2. **Validation workflows** - Source documents will validate our encoded tax rules
3. **Historical analysis** - Archived documents will enable accurate historical simulations
4. **Rules-as-code generation** - AI tools can generate Tax-Calculator JSON from policy documents

We commit to modifying Tax-Calculator to leverage the Policy Library API, demonstrating its value for rules-as-code projects nationwide.

## Contribution of Resources

PSL will contribute:

- **Tax documentation archive** - Federal tax forms, instructions, and publications from our validation datasets
- **State tax materials** - Documentation we've collected for state tax modeling initiatives  
- **Legislative tracking** - Materials from monitoring tax law changes since 2017
- **Technical expertise** - Our maintainers will help design the API for rules-as-code integration
- **Community connections** - We'll promote adoption across our network of 200+ contributors

## Impact on Open-Source Policy Modeling

The Policy Library addresses critical challenges in our community:

- **Broken links plague our documentation** - We regularly update dead URLs in Tax-Calculator
- **Reproducibility requires permanent archives** - Research from 5 years ago often can't be validated
- **Encoding errors stem from missing sources** - Direct document access will improve accuracy
- **International expansion needs infrastructure** - The Policy Library model can extend globally

## Commitment to PBIF Priorities

This project exemplifies using technology to improve safety net programs. Many benefit recipients interact with the tax system through EITC and CTC claims. Better documentation of these programs, and their interaction with traditional benefits, will reduce errors and improve take-up rates.

The open-source approach ensures maximum impact. Just as Tax-Calculator democratized tax analysis, the Policy Library will democratize access to policy documentation. This infrastructure will enable innovations we haven't yet imagined.

## Community Support

The PSL community has observed PolicyEngine's growth and impact over several years. They have demonstrated technical excellence, commitment to open-source principles, and ability to build tools that serve both researchers and practitioners. We are confident they will successfully deliver this critical infrastructure.

We enthusiastically support this application and look forward to integrating the Policy Library with our entire suite of open-source policy models.

Sincerely,

[Name]  
Director, Policy Simulation Library
