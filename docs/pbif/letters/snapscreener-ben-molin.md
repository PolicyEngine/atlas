# Letter of Support - SNAP Screener / BenefitWiki
**[DRAFT - To be sent from Ben Molin]**

Public Benefit Innovation Fund Review Committee

Dear PBIF Review Committee,

I'm writing to support PolicyEngine's application for the Policy Library. As co-founder of SNAP Screener and BenefitWiki, I've spent years building tools to help people determine their benefits eligibility, and the lack of reliable policy documentation is our biggest challenge.

## The Documentation Problem We Face Daily

To build SNAP Screener, Andreas Vandris and I had to manually review SNAP policy manuals from every state. This took months of work that could have been spent improving the tool itself. Even worse, these documents frequently move or disappear - we estimate we spend 20+ hours monthly just fixing broken links and finding relocated documents.

When state agencies update their websites, critical policy documents often vanish without warning. We've had to rebuild entire state calculations when we couldn't find the original source documents we'd relied on. This isn't sustainable, especially for small teams trying to help vulnerable populations.

## Why the Policy Library Matters

PolicyEngine's approach solves the exact problems we face:
- **Permanent archives** mean we'll never lose a document we've referenced
- **API access** lets us programmatically retrieve documents instead of manual searches
- **Version tracking** helps us understand when and how policies change
- **AI-powered monitoring** catches changes before they break our tools

The proposed solution would save us hundreds of hours annually that we could redirect toward helping more families access benefits.

## Our Contribution and Collaboration

SNAP Screener has assembled comprehensive documentation for all 50 states' SNAP programs, plus WIC eligibility rules. We're eager to contribute these documents to the Policy Library and would welcome the opportunity to:
- Share our collection of state policy manuals and implementation guides
- Provide feedback on the API design based on our eligibility calculator needs
- Test the document retrieval system with real-world use cases
- Help identify gaps in coverage from a practitioner perspective

## Impact on the Ecosystem

This infrastructure would transform how benefits screening tools operate. Instead of each organization maintaining their own fragile document collections, we could all rely on a shared, reliable source. This would enable:
- Faster development of new screening tools
- More accurate eligibility determinations
- Better coordination between different benefits programs
- Reduced duplication of effort across organizations

The Policy Library isn't just helpful - it's essential infrastructure that the benefits access ecosystem desperately needs.

Sincerely,

Ben Molin
