Re: PolicyEngine Policy Library Application

Dear Review Committee,

I'm writing to strongly support PolicyEngine's Policy Library application. As co-founder of SNAP Screener and BenefitWiki, which help thousands determine benefits eligibility, the lack of reliable policy documentation is our biggest operational challenge.

**The Problem:** To build SNAP Screener, we manually collected policy documents from all 50 states - months of work that documents frequently disappear when agencies update websites. We've had to rebuild entire state calculations when source documents vanished. This wastes hundreds of hours annually that could help families access benefits.

**Why This Matters:** PolicyEngine's Policy Library would provide:
- Permanent archives ensuring documents never disappear
- API access for programmatic retrieval
- Version tracking to monitor policy changes
- Shared infrastructure eliminating duplicate efforts across organizations

**Our Contribution:** We've assembled comprehensive SNAP, WIC, Medicaid, and Cash Assistance documentation across all states and are eager to contribute these to the Policy Library. We'll also provide API design feedback and real-world testing.

This isn't just helpful - it's essential infrastructure the benefits ecosystem desperately needs to serve vulnerable populations effectively.

Sincerely,

Ben Molin  
Co-Founder, SNAP Screener & BenefitWiki
