# PBIF Reviewer Evaluation: Yuri Kim
**Role**: Senior Program Officer, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Application**: PolicyEngine Policy Library

## Overall Score: 7.8/10

### Executive Summary
Strong technical proposal addressing real infrastructure needs. The partnership with Benefit Navigator (our existing grantee with Nava) adds credibility. However, needs stronger direct beneficiary engagement strategy and clearer metrics for measuring burden reduction.

### Strengths
- **Partnership with Gates Grantees**: Direct integration with Benefit Navigator strengthens our portfolio
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Solution can benefit multiple tools and organizations
- **Open Source Commitment**: Aligns with Gates Foundation's open access principles
- **Strong Technical Team**: PolicyEngine has proven track record with microsimulation models
- **Cost-Effective**: $700K delivers significant infrastructure for the field

### Concerns
- **Beneficiary Voice**: Limited discussion of how actual benefit recipients inform document prioritization
- **Equity Considerations**: How will the system ensure documents for marginalized communities are prioritized?
- **Language Access**: No mention of non-English document archival
- **Rural Access**: How does this help areas with limited digital infrastructure?

### Innovation Assessment
The AI-powered document extraction is innovative but not groundbreaking. The real innovation is in creating permanent, stable references for volatile government documents. The LLM benchmarking adds valuable research component.

### Impact Measurement
- **Quantitative Metrics**: 160,000 individuals reached annually is solid
- **Missing Metrics**: No clear measurement of actual burden reduction
- **Research Output**: LLM accuracy benchmarks valuable for field

### Partnership Quality
- **Strong**: MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Georgia Center for Opportunity
- **Notable**: Atlanta Fed collaboration adds government credibility
- **Missing**: Direct partnerships with state benefits agencies

### Sustainability Analysis
- **Year 1-2**: Grant funded development
- **Post-Grant**: PolicyEngine API revenue model seems viable
- **Risk**: Dependent on PolicyEngine's business model success
- **Opportunity**: Could explore foundation consortium funding

### Equity & Inclusion
- **Geographic Coverage**: 50+ jurisdictions is comprehensive
- **Language**: No mention of multilingual support
- **Accessibility**: No discussion of disability access considerations
- **Community Engagement**: Limited beneficiary involvement in design

### Recommendation
**FUND WITH CONDITIONS** - Require stronger beneficiary engagement plan and language access strategy. Consider requiring partnership with community-based organizations for document prioritization.

### Suggested Improvements
1. Add Spanish-language document archival in Year 1
2. Create beneficiary advisory board for document prioritization
3. Partner with legal aid organizations for document selection
4. Include metrics on actual time saved in benefit applications
5. Add accessibility audit requirement for all archived documents

### Questions for Applicant
1. How will you engage benefit recipients in prioritizing documents?
2. What is your strategy for non-English documents?
3. How will you measure actual burden reduction vs. just access?
4. Can you partner with legal aid organizations?
5. What happens if PolicyEngine's business model changes?

### Gates Foundation Alignment
- ✅ Reduces barriers to benefit access
- ✅ Open source and accessible
- ✅ Strengthens existing grantee (Benefit Navigator)
- ⚠️ Needs stronger equity focus
- ⚠️ Limited direct beneficiary engagement

### Final Assessment
This infrastructure investment would strengthen multiple tools in our portfolio. The technical approach is sound and team capable. However, the proposal needs stronger focus on equity and beneficiary engagement to fully align with Gates Foundation priorities. Recommend funding with requirements for language access and community engagement plans.
