# PBIF Reviewer Evaluation: Cassandra Madison
**Role**: Executive Director, Public Benefit Innovation Fund  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Application**: PolicyEngine Policy Library

## Overall Score: 8.5/10

### Executive Summary
This proposal presents a compelling infrastructure solution to a critical problem in benefits administration. The permanent archival of policy documents addresses real pain points for both direct service providers and the broader ecosystem. Strong AI integration aligns perfectly with PBIF priorities.

### Strengths
- **Clear Problem Definition**: Link rot and document disappearance is a documented issue affecting benefit calculators
- **Strong Partner Network**: MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, and Georgia Center for Opportunity demonstrate real-world validation
- **AI-First Approach**: Intelligent crawling and LLM benchmarking show sophisticated use of AI technology
- **Infrastructure Play**: Building foundational infrastructure that benefits the entire ecosystem
- **Reasonable Budget**: $700K is efficient for the scope and impact proposed

### Areas for Improvement
- **Sustainability Model**: While PolicyEngine API revenue is mentioned, more detail on long-term financial sustainability would strengthen the proposal
- **Human Review Burden**: GitHub PR review process may become bottleneck at scale
- **State Engagement**: Limited discussion of how to engage state agencies directly

### Innovation Assessment
The combination of AI-powered crawling with human verification through GitHub PRs is novel. The permanent source_id system replacing fragile URLs is a simple but powerful innovation. LLM benchmarking component adds research value beyond pure infrastructure.

### Impact Potential
- **Direct Impact**: 160,000 individuals annually through partner tools
- **Ecosystem Impact**: Infrastructure benefits any organization building benefit tools
- **Research Value**: Enables new research on benefit program complexity

### Technical Feasibility
Team demonstrates strong technical competence with existing PolicyEngine infrastructure. Git LFS and WARC storage choices are appropriate. OpenSearch integration well-considered. 12-month production deployment timeline appears achievable.

### Alignment with PBIF Goals
- ✅ AI-enabled technology
- ✅ Reduces administrative burden
- ✅ Focuses on SNAP, Medicaid, and safety net programs
- ✅ Within funding range ($500K-$2M)
- ✅ Can deploy within 12 months

### Recommendation
**FUND** - This proposal addresses a fundamental infrastructure gap that limits innovation in benefits technology. The team has proven capability and strong partnerships. The AI components are meaningful, not superficial additions.

### Questions for Discussion
1. How will you prioritize which documents to archive first?
2. What happens if states request removal of archived documents?
3. How will you measure accuracy improvements in LLM calculations?
4. Can the human review process scale to 100,000+ documents?

### Final Notes
This is exactly the type of infrastructure investment PBIF should support - it enables innovation across the entire ecosystem rather than just solving one organization's needs. The focus on permanence and stability addresses a core challenge in government technology.
