# PBIF Reviewer Evaluation: Korey Klein
**Role**: Director of Technology and Data, Ballmer Group  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Application**: PolicyEngine Policy Library

## Overall Score: 8.2/10

### Executive Summary
Excellent technical architecture with clear data strategy. The focus on structured data and API design aligns with Ballmer Group's emphasis on data-driven solutions. Strong potential for research applications and policy analysis beyond direct service delivery.

### Technical Architecture Assessment
- **Storage Strategy**: Git LFS + WARC is appropriate and scalable
- **Search Infrastructure**: OpenSearch selection shows good judgment
- **API Design**: Stable source_id system solves real problem
- **Version Control**: Git-based approach ensures full audit trail
- **AI Integration**: Practical use of LLMs for extraction, not hype

### Data Quality & Governance
- **Strengths**: Immutable archive, version tracking, human review process
- **Concerns**: No mention of data quality metrics or validation frameworks
- **Opportunity**: Could add automated quality checks and validation rules

### Scalability Analysis
- **Document Volume**: 100,000+ documents/year seems achievable
- **Storage**: Git LFS can handle, but costs may grow
- **Review Process**: GitHub PR model may bottleneck - needs automation
- **API Performance**: No discussion of caching or CDN strategy

### Research Applications
- **Policy Analysis**: Enables longitudinal studies of policy changes
- **Complexity Metrics**: Can quantify administrative burden systematically
- **LLM Benchmarking**: Valuable contribution to AI research
- **Cross-Jurisdiction Analysis**: Comparative studies become possible

### Budget Analysis
- **Personnel**: 1.85 FTE seems light for scope
- **Infrastructure**: $20K for cloud may be optimistic at scale
- **Partner Contracts**: Good leverage of partner resources
- **Overall**: Efficient use of funds, but may need more engineering resources

### Integration Potential
- **Government Systems**: Could integrate with state benefit systems
- **Research Databases**: Natural fit with Urban Institute, NBER datasets
- **Analytics Platforms**: Could feed into poverty measurement tools
- **Policy Modeling**: Enhances microsimulation capabilities

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Low - proven technologies and approach
- **Operational Risks**: Medium - human review bottleneck potential
- **Sustainability Risks**: Medium - dependent on PolicyEngine revenue
- **Legal Risks**: Low - public documents, but consider copyright edge cases

### Metrics & Evaluation
- **Good**: Clear document count targets, user reach numbers
- **Missing**: Performance metrics, quality scores, accuracy measures
- **Suggested**: Add uptime SLAs, search relevance scores, update latency

### Recommendation
**FUND** - Strong technical proposal that creates valuable data infrastructure. Would benefit from additional engineering resources and more robust quality metrics. Consider supplemental funding for expanded technical team.

### Technical Recommendations
1. Implement automated quality scoring for archived documents
2. Add CDN layer for API performance at scale
3. Create automated testing framework for document extraction
4. Build dashboard for real-time system metrics
5. Consider blockchain for immutability verification

### Questions for Technical Review
1. What is your disaster recovery and backup strategy?
2. How will you handle API rate limiting and abuse?
3. What quality metrics will you track for document extraction?
4. Can you automate more of the human review process?
5. How will you handle documents that change frequently?

### Ballmer Group Strategic Fit
- ✅ Creates valuable data infrastructure
- ✅ Enables research and analysis
- ✅ Open source and reusable
- ✅ Measurable impact potential
- ✅ Technical excellence

### Additional Opportunities
- Partner with academic institutions for research applications
- Create data quality certification program
