# Email to NBER re: PolicyEngine Policy Library Collaboration

**To:** [NBER TAXSIM team contact]
**Subject:** PolicyEngine Policy Library - PBIF Application Collaboration

Dear [Contact],

Following up on our TAXSIM MOU discussions, I'm writing about an opportunity to extend our collaboration through the PolicyEngine Policy Library project.

We're applying for a Public Benefit Innovation Fund (PBIF) grant to create comprehensive infrastructure for preserving and serving safety net program documentation. The library will archive statutes, regulations, and forms across all 50 states plus federal programs, preventing the document disappearance that hampers benefits administration (18% of 2019 benefit URLs are now dead).

**How NBER would contribute:**
- Share assembled tax documents from TAXSIM (historical coverage since 2018)
- These documents seed our library alongside contributions from Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Georgia Center for Opportunity, and other partners
- Your tax policy expertise ensures comprehensive coverage of tax-benefit interactions

**What we're building:**
- AI-powered crawlers monitor government websites weekly
- Permanent archive with stable API serving documents via source IDs
- Integration with tools like PolicyEngine, MyFriendBen, and Benefit Navigator
- LLM benchmark testing accuracy improvements when AI has document access

**Benefits to NBER:**
- Permanent preservation of tax documents you've assembled
- API access for TAXSIM and other NBER projects
- Attribution and citation for contributed documents
- Participation in rules-as-code generation experiments

The PBIF application is due August 16. Would you be willing to provide a brief letter of collaboration confirming:
1. NBER will contribute assembled tax documents via existing TAXSIM MOU
2. Interest in using the Policy Library API for research
3. Value of comprehensive document preservation for tax policy analysis

Budget: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJdmn3IF09h0YA7hYeem80CCfDc1z8jYdeCkq5Phknw/edit

Thank you for considering this collaboration. Happy to discuss how this builds on our existing partnership.

Best,
