The speaker
Um, policy engines, the premier.

The speaker
Open source platform for blah, blah, blah.

The speaker
Adopted in many aspects of the UK.

The speaker
Um, heralded by the NSF.

The speaker
Embraced by Leading Scholars.

The speaker
And think tanks. Babel house in this Cannon.

The speaker
An open source platform is, uh, you know, only way ideal way.

The speaker
To help the eco, you know, an open source platform for?

The speaker
You know? What is an upstream cross-cutting tool that enable all of the grants you know awarded here?

The speaker
Um, will allow them to reach the fullest potential.

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
Um, policy engine just doesn't reach academics. It's the driving force between.

The speaker
Um, read.

The speaker
Beneficiary, facing tools such as my friend Ben and benefit Navigator together, you know. Through these close Partnerships, we've identified.

The speaker
Two gaps in the tool infrastructure.

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
That they've identified for their own applications to this process.

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
This grant aims to address those gaps and provide.

The speaker
Um, opportunities and and and also requests.

The speaker
It's a lot, you know, if available to include projects, you know?

The speaker
So, what's you know training, um, other grantees and the use of this tool and?

The speaker
Landscape scans to?

The speaker
Identify what other?

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
Pools are needed.

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
The most simple and compelling example is the challenge of document management.

The speaker
You know?

The speaker
Everyone has to reinvent that wheel, and no one should have to.

The speaker
But our our proposals, you know?

The speaker
But this is just one component of our application. See details, you know, and then the details that come in another section.

You
Yeah.

The speaker
Something like that?

You
Yeah.

You
I wonder if we need more of a like? Here's the can we paint a picture of specifically? Here's the world.

You
Creating. If we execute on this project, right?

The speaker
Yeah, then you go from that, you say?

The speaker
You know?

The speaker
Um, we envision a world where these tools are increasingly user friendly.

The speaker
You know they allow?

The speaker
Service providers government, you know what I mean?

The speaker
Blah, blah, blah.

You
Yeah.

You
Um.

The speaker
And you click that either above, you know?

The speaker
Is an opening policy engine is committed to a world where blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

The speaker
Behind all of that is.

The speaker
Was a Cutting Edge open source system that we already are policies, and it's already made.

The speaker
You know internationally acclaimed strides in this direction?

The speaker
Um, you could say things like?

The speaker
These tools are not things that people should have to pay for.

The speaker
You know?

The speaker
The easier the tool, the greater variety of groups can.

The speaker
You know, the further your grantees can go with their beneficiary facing things and the more available it will be, you know?

The speaker
Others.

The speaker
He didn't apply. You know, you could make some nod to Dei like stuff, you know, like?

The speaker
Specialize.

The speaker
Nonprofits that Target, but you know that tailor?

The speaker
Blah, blah, blah to specific.

The speaker
Cultural and Regional audiences.

The speaker
I don't know if you, I don't know what you do about Dei anymore. I don't know what to say about.

You
Um.

You
I wonder if I need something like that for the?

You
The complexity.

You
Peace there and!

The speaker
Yeah.

The speaker
I don't know.

The speaker
Um, I'll I'll have a little bit of time. I could read something, maybe?

You
Yeah, I'll put something together. Yeah.

The speaker
But Max, write this first.

You
Yeah.

The speaker
You know?

The speaker
Write this first.

You
Okay.

The speaker
That would be my gut, and I think the NSF award is like, you know, amazing. Is that the one I wrote some of it for?

You
Um, yeah, I think we continue. It was, it's very similar to the.

You
Yeah, it is.

The speaker
Yay!

The speaker
Cuz, that was a pain in the ass. Um, I didn't like fighting with you and.

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
Yeah, you gotta word it. That makes me feel like it was all worth it.

You
Yeah.

The speaker
Um, but you've got to milk that for all, it's worth here.

The speaker
You know, you finally got a big government. F****** Grant.

The speaker
Right, so you have to tout it and then say, but you know, we don't view this as an academic Enterprise. The project demands.

The speaker
Academically rigorous tested rules engine.

The speaker
That are made accessible, you know, but we make them excess. I, I don't know what you know, what I mean, but we make them accessible.

You
Oh, and the other stuff around isn't isn't about academic evaluation. It's about getting it into the world. So, it, it does feel.

You
I think quite well with the whole purpose of this grant, like.

The speaker
Yeah, okay, you could spin it that way, but you're also.

The speaker
The NSF Grant. I wouldn't want to skip over the fact that it's an endorsement of the rigor of your product.

You
Yep, good point.

The speaker
You know, cuz you got a lot of endorsements for that, and don't skip over too quickly.

The speaker
That you're still too often looked at as a newcomer.

The speaker
You know?

You
Yeah.

The speaker
You know you're embraced in the UK across the policy sector?

The speaker
Um, from government to think, tanks, you know you don't have. You can at least say that about the pen Downing Street thing. You can point to the open source contributions, I mean.

The speaker
In the in the. Whatever your repository is, whatever it's called, you know?

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
You know, try to work on something like that.

The speaker
And just know that at this point Max, you have enough detail. Okay.

The speaker
Your challenge is to organize the detail.

The speaker
And this grant doesn't have to say.

The speaker
Every last thing you would do.

The speaker
Right at some point down the logic tree of the hierarchical organization of this project. You have to cut it off what you want to do is not frame the proposal in a way that precludes all of those things.

The speaker
But some of them are pretty, you know, far Downstream?

The speaker
Um, and I think that the scoring.

The speaker
It doesn't have to be embraced by government to be useful.

The speaker
I, I don't think that.

You
Yeah, um.

You
Yeah, I just don't know. I, I mean.

You
I, it doesn't. If we're doing the scoring thing, like it's more than a detail, and if they're cutting everyone off, who doesn't have a clear beneficiary facing tool or government partner, then I might think more creatively, but I think I mean you, you seem to think it's it's more about.

You
Um.

You
Yeah, like.

You
Sorry, sorry, flat went off.

You
But uh.

You
Like, we can pay a story about the impact, and that's what matters.

You
Right?

The speaker
Yeah.

The speaker
Yeah.

The speaker
Well, that all seems really good. And I, I thought, that NSF thing was already.

The speaker
Complete it. What was the piece of information you told me before? I thought it was already.

You
They, we got the recommendation from the program committee, but it still had to go through, like an administrative, some budget review.

You
Um.

You
So, that's what we got confirmation on today.

The speaker
Amazing!

You
Yeah.

The speaker
So, Max, I'm starting like, it's fun to have these calls. I'm just about to finalize something with somebody new.

The speaker
You know?

The speaker
You know?

The speaker
I have a lot of control over what I put.

The speaker
How many hours the retainer covers?

The speaker
Um, so?

The speaker
You know, this is the time.

The speaker
If you want to keep having these conversations to, you know?

The speaker
I can, you know?

The speaker
Balance it a little bit.

The speaker
But um?

The speaker
You let me know. Think it, you know, let me know over the weekend. Once you get this thing in, you know?

The speaker
Um, because if you wanted to bump it up and have me read more things, you know, I got it. I can't take.

The speaker
I'm already on a half-time retainer, and this guy wants a half-time retainer, but you're more fun.

You
Yeah, um.

The speaker
So don't answer. Now, just put your, you know, your thoughts together, um?

The speaker
It's raining, and we don't have a dinner residence, and our friends are out for dinner somewhere else, so I could look at something else tonight. Just remember.

The speaker
You know?

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
90 minutes ahead of you and I go to bed early.

You
Okay, yeah, I'm going to bed earlier these days, too. So, um?

You
Uh.

You
I, I think we would love to think about.

You
Like the broader Grant strategy. Yeah, what short portfolio?

You
Contacts be, um?

You
I think once this is done, we'll have some bandwidth to think about that.

You
So, yeah.

The speaker
What happened?

You
Um, no, I haven't continued.

You
Speaking with her.

You
I should probably see where she's at, but.

You
Um.

You
I mean.

The speaker
Well, I still think that.

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
I still think, like, once you get Congressional districts out like, it'll be transformative. I still think you need to have, like, a really good communication strategy about that rollout.

The speaker
Um.

You
Yeah, and uh, I mean bands are built. Just said they want to bring us on to some grants with PCI.

You
Um.

You
Oh, pritzker!

The speaker
You didn't hear from pritzger?

You
Yeah, I, I, no, um?

You
But I think.

You
Um.

You
I was going to send another email once. We, we have like one more ACA kind of thing. We were going to put out just to give her like a flavor of the kind research we do.

You
But yeah, it's been like two weeks I don't know. Is that?

The speaker
I don't know, but.

The speaker
Mcclure earthquake Vanderbilt.

The speaker
Is a is a big grantee, right?

You
Oh yeah.

The speaker
Of that.

The speaker
I would think that you could.

The speaker
Give her an update on.

The speaker
On those things, couldn't you?

You
Yeah, and maybe they want to start by just funding us through Vanderbilt. I guess that'll be okay, but?

You
She seemed open, so.

You
Something to rest.

The speaker
No, I guess I'm.

The speaker
If you can use the Vanderbilt thing to pressure her to.

The speaker
As an update that can reinvigorate the conversation to get some direct funding.

You
Yeah.

You
Well, the the fact that they signed on to this project or?

The speaker
Yeah.

The speaker
Yeah.

You
Yeah.

You
Okay.

The speaker
Um.

The speaker
I also, would you know, I think, as NSF thing is?

The speaker
You know something you could update her on?

You
Yeah, we're gonna do a blog post on it for sure.

The speaker
Well, that you can't expect that woman to go around reading your blog post.

You
I don't know. I don't know, I know, yeah.

The speaker
And I, you know, I, I think we can say, you know, that, um?

The speaker
You know this proposal?

The speaker
While focused on the you know accessibility?

The speaker
Um, required, you know, considerable?

The speaker
Recommend, you know, multiple recommendations.

The speaker
You know about the validity and?

The speaker
Of the tool and the expertise we bring to the project or something like that?

You
Yeah, I mean, the.

You
Tablehouses recommendation surely helped with.

The speaker
Yeah, well, I think that's a great way to put a, you know, it required a lot of validation, um, including um, we were gratified that John stable house X, Y, and Z at Brookings submitted a strong letter of support.
