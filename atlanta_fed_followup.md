# Follow-up Email to Alex Ruder

**Subject:** Re: PBIF Application Materials - Atlanta Fed Sections

Quick follow-up - 

If there's interest from your team in co-authoring any reports or case studies from this work (analyzing policy preservation patterns, LLM accuracy improvements, etc.), we'd be thrilled to include that. Could strengthen both our application and the research impact.

No pressure if that's outside scope - just wanted to offer the option since the research outputs could be valuable for the Fed's policy work.
