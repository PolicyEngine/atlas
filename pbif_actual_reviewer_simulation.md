# PBIF Summer 2025 Reviewer Simulation - Actual Review Panel
## PolicyEngine Policy Library Application ($634,755)

Based on the actual PBIF advisors and their backgrounds, simulating their review perspectives.

## YURI KIM - Senior Program Officer, Gates Foundation
**Background:** Deep experience in global development, AI for social good, and scaling interventions

### Review Comments:

**What I Like:**
"This is exactly the type of infrastructure play Gates would fund. The Policy Library solves a fundamental problem that blocks every other intervention. I've seen this exact issue in our work with Benefit Navigator - broken links waste enormous time and create barriers for vulnerable families."

**Strategic Value:**
"The $138,000 in partner contracts is smart - it builds ecosystem buy-in. I particularly appreciate the confirmed letter from Benefit Navigator, which is a Gates/Nava partnership. This creates immediate synergy with our existing investments."

**AI Approach:**
"The human-in-the-loop design via GitHub PRs is sophisticated. Using Claude/GPT-4 as intelligent crawlers rather than trying to build custom ML is pragmatic. The 24 percentage point accuracy improvement in LLM calculations is compelling and measurable."

**Budget Assessment:**
"$634,755 is conservative for the scope. The 1.8 FTE with AI leverage is innovative - exactly how modern teams should operate. The 10% indirect when they could claim 15% shows fiscal responsibility."

**Concerns:**
"State government adoption will be critical. I'd like to see more MOUs with state agencies beyond the Federal Reserve partnership. The timeline is ambitious but the existing pilots with NC and Atlanta Fed give confidence."

**Score: 4.7/5**
**Recommendation: STRONG FUND**

**Yuri's Bottom Line:**
"This is infrastructure that makes every other PBIF investment more effective. The Gates Foundation has learned that document preservation is critical for sustained impact. Fund this and require quarterly reports on state adoption."

## KOREY KLEIN - Director of Technology and Data, Ballmer Group
**Background:** Focus on data-driven solutions, government technology, and evidence-based interventions

### Review Comments:

**Data Strategy:**
"Finally, someone taking document preservation seriously! The Ballmer Group has invested millions in data infrastructure, and broken government links undermine everything. The commitment to open data with bulk exports is exactly right."

**Technical Architecture:**
"Smart technical choices throughout:
- PostgreSQL + S3 is proven and scalable
- Using OpenStates schema shows good judgment
- MCP server for LLM integration is forward-thinking
- CloudFlare CDN ensures performance

The $20k for cloud infrastructure seems light but manageable if they leverage existing PolicyEngine infrastructure."

**Impact Metrics:**
"I appreciate the specific, measurable goals:
- 100,000+ documents by Month 24
- 99.9% API uptime
- 50+ jurisdictions coverage
- 10,000 hours saved annually

These are trackable and meaningful. The LLM benchmark with 10,000 test cases will provide valuable public data."

**Team Composition:**
"The lean team (0.7 FTE Lead, 0.5 ML Engineer, 0.35 Policy Analyst, 0.25 Community) with $30k in AI tools is exactly how to leverage modern technology. This is 10x more efficient than traditional approaches."

**Score: 4.8/5**
**Recommendation: FUND**

**Korey's Bottom Line:**
"This aligns perfectly with Ballmer Group's focus on government effectiveness. The open-source approach and public data commitment multiply the investment's value. I'd advocate for additional Ballmer Group co-funding."

## KUMAR GARG - President, Renaissance Philanthropy
**Background:** Former White House technology advisor, focus on breakthrough innovations and systemic change

### Review Comments:

**Systems Thinking:**
"This proposal demonstrates exceptional systems thinking. Rather than another point solution, PolicyEngine identified the root infrastructure problem. This reminds me of successful federal initiatives like Data.gov - seemingly boring but transformational."

**Policy Integration:**
"Having worked in the White House, I know how critical document preservation is for policy implementation. The CaseText shutdown example is powerful - private infrastructure can't be relied upon for public needs."

**Innovation Approach:**
"Using AI for intelligent crawling rather than building another benefits calculator shows maturity. The $30k investment in Claude/GPT-4/Copilot tools is smart - buy vs build for commodity AI."

**Partnerships:**
"Strong partner roster:
- MyFriendBen (3,500 users) - real users
- Georgia Center for Opportunity - policy credibility  
- PN3 Policy Center - research validation
- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta - government endorsement

The $15k for Citizen Codex UX research shows user-centered thinking."

**Sustainability:**
"The path to sustainability is credible - API revenue, government contracts, and foundation support. Starting with 10% indirect (vs 15% allowed) leaves room for growth."

**Score: 4.6/5**
**Recommendation: FUND**

**Kumar's Bottom Line:**
"This is the type of boring-but-critical infrastructure that government should provide but doesn't. Perfect fit for philanthropic catalytic funding. Would benefit from federal agency champion - consider engaging USDS or 18F."

## ANDREW COY - CEO, Digital Harbor Foundation
**Background:** Education technology, youth development, community-driven innovation

### Review Comments:

**Community Approach:**
"The open-source commitment and community engagement plan are exemplary. Monthly community calls, public GitHub discussions, and documentation wiki show commitment to collaborative development."

**Accessibility:**
"I'm pleased to see:
- Google Translate API for 100+ languages
- Citizen Codex for accessibility testing
- Free tier for nonprofits
- Focus on reducing administrative burden

This will help community organizations serving immigrant and limited-English populations."

**Educational Value:**
"The public LLM benchmark and quarterly learning reports create valuable educational resources. This could be used to teach civic tech and AI applications."

**Direct Service Impact:**
"The testimonial from MyFriendBen about wasting 20+ hours/month on broken links resonates. Every community organization faces this. The $138k in partner contracts shows commitment to grassroots organizations."

**Youth Opportunity:**
"Would love to see internship opportunities for youth to contribute to document archiving and verification. The GitHub PR review process creates natural mentorship moments."

**Score: 4.5/5**
**Recommendation: FUND**

**Andrew's Bottom Line:**
"This democratizes access to critical government information. The community-driven approach aligns with Digital Harbor's values. Would strongly support with the addition of youth engagement components."

### Executive Summary for Board:

**Reviewer Consensus:**
- Average Score: **4.65/5**

- **Korey**: Aligns with Ballmer Group's data infrastructure focus
- **Kumar**: Exemplifies systemic change through boring-but-critical infrastructure
- **Andrew**: Community-driven approach with accessibility focus

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Existing PolicyEngine infrastructure reduces technical risk
- Phased rollout (10 states → 30 → 50+) manageable
- Multiple revenue paths for sustainability
- Human oversight via GitHub PRs ensures quality

**Recommended Conditions:**
1. Quarterly reports on state coverage
2. Public release of LLM benchmark by Month 6
3. Priority deployment in states with confirmed partners
4. Youth engagement component per Andrew's suggestion

**Funding Recommendation:**
**APPROVE $634,755 over 24 months**

**Rationale:** 
"The Policy Library represents exactly the type of enabling infrastructure PBIF should fund. It strengthens the entire safety net ecosystem while demonstrating responsible AI deployment. The combination of technical sophistication, community engagement, and practical impact makes this a model PBIF investment."

## COMPARISON TO OTHER PROPOSALS

Based on PBIF's typical portfolio, this proposal would rank in the **TOP 10%** because:

1. **Infrastructure over applications** - Enables many other solutions
2. **Confirmed government partnership** - Federal Reserve involvement is unique
3. **Below-median budget** - $635k vs typical $1-1.5M asks
4. **Proven team** - PolicyEngine's track record with benefits calculators
5. **Clear metrics** - Specific, measurable, achievable goals

**Predicted Outcome: FUNDED WITH ENTHUSIASM**

The actual PBIF advisors would likely champion this as a cornerstone investment that multiplies the impact of other grants.
