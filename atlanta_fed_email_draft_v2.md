**Subject:** PBIF Application Materials - Atlanta Fed Sections

Hi Alex,

Here are the materials as discussed:

**Application:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hUQOhh1YVdwHReQx7LBRpYL8QTe9K37iM6J1sQNGncw/edit?tab=t.0
**Budget:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJdmn3IF09h0YA7hYeem80CCfDc1z8jYdeCkq5Phknw

We've described the Atlanta Fed's involvement as:
- Three-way collaboration with PolicyEngine and GCO on document collection (nationwide scope)
- Contributing documents compatible with Policy Rules Database format
- Participation in rules-as-code evaluation (testing LLM generation for your open-source format)
- No funds allocated to the Fed
- No formal deliverables or joint reports required

Happy to modify any language to work for your legal team. Let me know if any adjustments would be helpful.

Thanks,
Max
