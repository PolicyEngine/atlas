Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - PBIF Application

Hi Jim and Dan,

Quick request as we apply for PBIF funding: We're proposing the PolicyEngine Policy Library - AI-powered permanent archiving of benefit policy documents. Given our ongoing TAXSIM emulation work and validation efforts, thought this might be of mutual interest.

Project at policyengine.github.io/policy-library

Dan, the tax forms you've collected over the years for TAXSIM would be perfect seed content - they're exactly the kind of historical policy documents that researchers need but can't find when government sites reorganize.

Would NBER be willing to provide a letter of collaboration? We'd acknowledge NBER's contribution of historical tax forms and commit to making the library useful for economic research. No funds involved - just research collaboration.

Other partners include Atlanta Fed, Georgetown, USC, Urban Institute (potentially), MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator.

Due Saturday (sorry!) - happy to draft something if helpful, though I imagine you'd prefer your own language.

Best,
Max
