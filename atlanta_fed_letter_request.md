# Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Letter of Collaboration Request

## For: Alex Ruder, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta

### Grant Description Paragraph

PolicyEngine is applying for a $675,059 grant from the Public Benefit Innovation Fund (PBIF), a groundbreaking initiative funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Ballmer Group, and Families and Workers Fund to accelerate AI-enabled technology that reduces administrative burden in America's safety net programs. Our project, the PolicyEngine Policy Library, will create a permanently archived, AI-powered collection of policy documents (statutes, regulations, implementation memos, and forms) for safety net programs across all 50+ U.S. jurisdictions. Using Claude and GPT-5 to intelligently monitor and extract documents from government websites weekly, the library will prevent the critical problem of disappearing policy documentsâ€”where broken links and website reorganizations cause essential program information to vanish, disrupting benefits access tools nationwide. The system will provide stable APIs ensuring that caseworkers, researchers, benefits navigators, and AI tools always have access to current, authoritative documents for SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and other critical programs. The library will also be integrated directly into caseworker training materials by our partners MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator, ensuring frontline staff always learn from the most current policy documents.

### Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Collaboration (NO FUNDS ALLOCATED)

The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta will collaborate with PolicyEngine and Georgia Center for Opportunity on the PolicyEngine Policy Library project. **Importantly, no grant funds will be allocated to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.** The collaboration will include:

- Continuing the existing collaboration with PolicyEngine and Georgia Center for Opportunity on seeding the library with documents in our respective models (nationwide scope)
- Participation in rules-as-code evaluation, helping test LLM generation for the Atlanta Fed's open-source Policy Rules Database format
- Sharing expertise and feedback on document organization and metadata standards based on the Policy Rules Database experience
- No formal deliverables or joint reports required

This collaboration builds on our successful pilot work together archiving federal and North Carolina safety net program documents, demonstrating the value of preserving policy documentation for research and public benefit. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's participation strengthens the project through its extensive experience with policy documentation and commitment to making economic data and analysis accessible to the public.

### Email Draft to Send

Subject: PolicyEngine Policy Library - Letter of Collaboration Request

Dear Alex,

Thank you so much for your legal team's approval of the collaboration language and your encouraging words about our application! 

As we prepare for submission, would it be possible to get a letter of collaboration from the Atlanta Fed on official letterhead? I've drafted language below that emphasizes the Fed is not receiving any funds and describes the collaboration in terms consistent with what your legal team approved.

[Insert paragraphs above]

The letter would be most helpful if it could be signed by an appropriate authority at the Atlanta Fed. We're working toward the August 16, 2025 deadline, so having the letter by early August would be ideal.

Please feel free to adjust this language as needed to meet any additional requirements from your legal team. The key points we'd like to convey are:
1. The Atlanta Fed is collaborating on this important public benefit infrastructure
2. No funds are allocated to the Atlanta Fed
3. The collaboration continues our successful pilot work together

Thank you again for your support and collaboration. Your team's expertise has been invaluable in shaping this project.

Best regards,
Max Ghenis
CEO, PolicyEngine
