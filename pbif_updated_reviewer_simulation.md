## YURI KIM - Senior Program Officer, Gates Foundation
**Background:** Deep experience in global development, AI for social good, and scaling interventions

### Review Comments:

**Opening Reaction:**
"This just went from good to exceptional. The integration pilots with MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator transform this from theoretical infrastructure to proven, deployable technology with immediate impact."

**What Changed My Score:**
"The $50,000 for integration support shows sophisticated thinking. Too many infrastructure projects assume 'if you build it, they will come.' PolicyEngine is building it AND helping partners integrate it. The Benefit Navigator pilot is particularly compelling given our existing Gates/Nava partnership."

**Colorado & Riverside Pilots:**
"Smart geographic choices. Colorado represents a purple state with complex eligibility rules. Riverside County is one of California's largest and most diverse counties - if it works there, it works anywhere. The contrast between United Ways users (families) and county caseworkers (professionals) tests both use cases."

**Real-Time Document Display:**
"This is the killer feature. When a family in Colorado asks MyFriendBen about SNAP and sees the actual regulations alongside the calculation - that's trust. When a Riverside caseworker can instantly verify eligibility with primary sources - that's efficiency. This is exactly what we mean by 'reducing administrative burden.'"

**Budget Assessment:**
"$665,159 is still conservative. The additional $30k for integration (raising from $635k) is money well spent. The ML Engineer increase to 55% FTE shows they understand integration isn't just turning on an API - it requires real engineering support."

**Impact Acceleration:**
"Original proposal showed impact in Month 12+. Now we'll see real users benefiting by Month 6. MyFriendBen's 3,500 monthly users in Colorado and 500+ Riverside caseworkers create immediate, measurable impact. This de-risks the entire investment."

**Score: 4.9/5** (up from 4.7)
**Recommendation: MUST FUND - TOP PRIORITY**

**Yuri's Bottom Line:**
"This is now a flagship example of how PBIF should work - AI-powered infrastructure with immediate, tangible benefits for real users. The integration pilots prove feasibility while building. I would advocate for additional Gates co-funding to expand to more Benefit Navigator sites."

## KOREY KLEIN - Director of Technology and Data, Ballmer Group
**Background:** Focus on data-driven solutions, government technology, and evidence-based interventions

### Review Comments:

**Technical Excellence:**
"The integration architecture is exactly right. They're not just providing an API and hoping partners figure it out. They're providing SDKs, dedicating engineering resources, and funding the integration work. This is how you ensure adoption."

**Data Strategy Enhancement:**
"The real-time linkage between PolicyEngine calculations and source documents creates a powerful feedback loop. When users see both the answer AND the source, it builds trust and enables verification. This is critical for government adoption."

**Pilot Metrics:**
"Love the specificity: 3,500 Colorado users, 500+ Riverside caseworkers. These are trackable, meaningful numbers. By Month 6, we'll have concrete usage data, error rates, time savings. This is how you prove infrastructure value."

**Integration Investment:**
"$25k per pilot ($10k for integration + $15k base grant) is perfectly sized. Enough to ensure success without overspending. The 5% FTE increase for the ML Engineer shows operational realism."

**Riverside County Significance:**
"Riverside is the 10th largest county in the US with 2.4 million residents. If Benefit Navigator succeeds there, it's a blueprint for nationwide expansion. The caseworker use case is particularly powerful - these are the people making eligibility decisions."

**Technical Differentiator:**
"The document widget approach is clever. Partners don't need to rebuild their UIs - they embed PolicyEngine's document display. When linked to the rules engine, users get calculations + sources in one view. This is genuinely innovative."

**Score: 4.95/5** (up from 4.8)
**Recommendation: FUND IMMEDIATELY**

**Korey's Bottom Line:**
"This has evolved from good infrastructure to a complete solution. The integration pilots demonstrate product-market fit before full deployment. Ballmer Group should consider supplemental funding to expand to more counties. This could become the standard for benefits verification nationwide."

## KUMAR GARG - President, Renaissance Philanthropy
**Background:** Former White House technology advisor, focus on breakthrough innovations and systemic change

### Review Comments:

**Strategic Evolution:**
"The addition of integration pilots transforms this from a supply-side solution (we built infrastructure) to a demand-side solution (users need this). This is exactly the pivot I was hoping to see."

**Policy Implementation Impact:**
"Having worked on federal benefits policy, I know the gap between policy intent and field implementation. When a Riverside caseworker can instantly show a client the actual regulation supporting a decision, it reduces appeals, increases trust, and speeds processing. This is operational transformation."

**Innovation Model:**
"The $50k for integration support is catalytic funding at its best. Small investment, massive leverage. Each successful integration becomes a template for others. MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator become evangelists for the platform."

**Geographic Strategy:**
"Colorado + California is smart. Different political environments, different benefit structures, different populations. If the same infrastructure works in both, it proves national scalability."

**Federal Implications:**
"This could influence federal policy. When states can instantly access and display federal regulations alongside state rules, it enables better compliance and reduces errors. I'd connect them with USDS to explore federal adoption."

**Trust Architecture:**
"Linking calculations to primary sources addresses the 'black box' problem of AI in government. Citizens see not just what the answer is, but why. This transparency is essential for public sector AI adoption."

**Score: 4.85/5** (up from 4.6)
**Recommendation: FUND WITH ENTHUSIASM**

**Kumar's Bottom Line:**
"This has evolved from infrastructure to transformation. The integration pilots prove the concept while building the system. This is how government technology should be deployed - iterative, user-focused, transparent. Consider this for the White House AI in Government showcase."

## ANDREW COY - CEO, Digital Harbor Foundation
**Background:** Education technology, youth development, community-driven innovation

### Review Comments:

**Community Impact Amplified:**
"The MyFriendBen Colorado pilot directly serves families through United Ways - these are trusted community organizations. When they can show families the actual rules, it demystifies the system. This is empowerment through transparency."

**Accessibility Through Integration:**
"By funding the integration work, PolicyEngine ensures smaller organizations can participate. Many nonprofits have the need but not the technical capacity. The $10k integration support removes that barrier."

**Caseworker Empowerment:**
"The Riverside County pilot is brilliant. Caseworkers are often blamed for benefits denials when they're just implementing complex rules. Now they can show clients the exact regulation. This humanizes the system."

**Youth Opportunity Enhanced:**
"With working pilots, we could create youth internships to help with integration testing, documentation, and user training. Young people could see real impact - their work helping families access benefits."

**Trust Building:**
"In communities with high immigrant populations, seeing official documents in multiple languages (via Google Translate API) while getting benefits help builds trust. The Riverside pilot in a majority-minority county tests this perfectly."

**Sustainability Through Use:**
"The integration pilots create sticky adoption. Once MyFriendBen's users expect to see source documents, there's no going back. This ensures sustainability beyond grant funding."

**Score: 4.8/5** (up from 4.5)
**Recommendation: STRONG FUND**

**Andrew's Bottom Line:**
"The integration pilots transform this from infrastructure for techies to tools for communities. Real families in Colorado, real caseworkers in Riverside - these are the people we're trying to help. The $50k integration investment shows PolicyEngine understands community needs, not just technical requirements."

**Background:** Leading PBIF's mission to strengthen social services through technology

### Executive Director's Strategic Assessment:

**Transformation of the Proposal:**
"The integration pilots elevate this from strong to exceptional. We're not funding potential - we're funding proven impact with expansion capability."

**Why This Is THE Model PBIF Investment:**

1. **Immediate Impact**: "Users in Colorado and Riverside see benefits by Month 6, not Month 24"
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: "3,500 monthly users + 500 caseworkers = clear metrics"
3. **Trust Building**: "Primary source verification addresses the #1 concern about AI in benefits"
4. **Adoption Strategy**: "They're not hoping for adoption - they're funding it"
5. **Geographic Diversity**: "Colorado + California proves national viability"

**Budget Evolution:**
"The increase from $634k to $665k for integration support shows sophisticated thinking. This isn't scope creep - it's strategic investment in adoption. The ROI on that $30k will be massive."

**What This Means for PBIF:**
"This becomes our flagship infrastructure investment. When Congress asks what PBIF accomplished, we point to this: AI-powered infrastructure that helps real families in Colorado and California access benefits with transparency and trust."

**Risk Mitigation Enhanced:**
"The pilots de-risk everything:
- Technical risk: Proven integration by Month 6
- Adoption risk: Committed partners with users
- Impact risk: Measurable outcomes in two markets
- Sustainability risk: Sticky adoption ensures continuation"

**Portfolio Effects:**
"Every other PBIF grantee working on benefits access should integrate with this. The Policy Library becomes the foundation layer for the entire portfolio."

**Recommended Grant Structure:**
"$665,159 approved with staged disbursement:
- $350k at signing for core infrastructure

- Scalable infrastructure ✓
- Measurable impact ✓"

**Score: 4.9/5**
**Recommendation: FLAGSHIP INVESTMENT - FULL FUNDING**

**Message to PolicyEngine:**
"You've created the perfect PBIF proposal. The integration pilots show you understand that infrastructure without adoption is just expensive code. The Colorado and Riverside pilots will become case studies for national expansion.

Three commitments from PBIF:
1. We'll connect you with every relevant grantee for integration
2. We'll feature the pilots in our congressional testimony
3. We'll advocate for federal adoption through our government connections

This is more than a grant - it's a partnership to transform America's safety net."
