# PBIF Application Review: PolicyEngine Policy Library
**Reviewer:** Yuri Kim, Senior Program Officer, Gates Foundation  
**Date:** August 8, 2025  
**Application ID:** PolicyEngine-Policy-Library-PBIF-2025

---

## Executive Summary

This application presents an ambitious and well-conceived solution to a critical infrastructure problem affecting millions of Americans accessing safety net programs. The Policy Library addresses document preservation and accessibility challenges that disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. While technically sound, the application requires deeper analysis of equity implications and community-centered design.

## Scoring

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Impact** | 8.5/10 | Strong potential to serve 160,000 people annually with clear pathways to scale |
| **Technical Feasibility** | 9/10 | Proven team with operational pilots and realistic technical approach |
| **Responsible AI** | 7/10 | Good framework but needs stronger equity focus in implementation |
| **Strategic Fit** | 8/10 | Aligns well with PBIF mission, addresses clear market failure |
| **Scalability** | 9/10 | Exceptional scalability potential geographically and across program types |

**Overall Score: 8.3/10**

## Strengths from Equity & Scale Perspective

### 1. Clear Equity Impact
The application demonstrates understanding that document disappearance disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. The 18% URL death rate represents a systemic barrier to benefit access that hits hardest on families least equipped to navigate bureaucratic alternatives.

### 2. Impressive Scale Potential
- **Geographic Coverage:** All 50 states + federal creates nationwide equity
- **Document Volume:** 100,000+ documents archived addresses comprehensive need
- **Partner Network:** Reaching 160,000 people through existing trusted organizations
- **Sustainability Model:** Self-funding approach ensures long-term availability

### 3. Systems-Level Thinking
This isn't just a technology solution - it's infrastructure repair. The team understands that broken links are symptomatic of broader systemic issues around information access and administrative burden.

### 4. Strong Implementation Track Record
PolicyEngine's existing microsimulation work demonstrates capacity to execute complex technical projects at scale. The operational pilots (NC sources, Atlanta Fed collaboration) provide confidence in delivery.

## Concerns & Areas for Improvement

### 1. Community-Centered Design Gap
**Concern:** While the application mentions community contributions, there's limited evidence of deep community engagement in design and implementation.

**Recommendation:** Strengthen community partnerships beyond current academic/government focus. Include community organizations serving benefit recipients directly in the design process.

### 2. Language & Accessibility
**Concern:** Spanish language support relegated to "Year 2 planning" when 13% of Americans are Spanish speakers.

**Recommendation:** Accelerate multilingual support or provide clear interim solutions. Consider partnership with organizations like UnidosUS or local community groups.

### 3. Digital Divide Considerations
**Concern:** No clear discussion of how this benefits people without reliable internet access or digital literacy.

**Recommendation:** Partner with libraries, community centers, and CBOs to ensure offline access pathways. Consider print-friendly formats and community training programs.

### 4. Power Dynamics
**Concern:** While documents are public, the system could inadvertently advantage well-resourced organizations over grassroots groups.

**Recommendation:** Include explicit equity commitments like free access tiers for community organizations and capacity building for smaller partners.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Near-Term (Months 1-6)
1. **Community Advisory Board:** Establish board including benefit recipients and community advocates
2. **Equity Impact Assessment:** Develop framework for measuring differential impact across communities
3. **Partnership Expansion:** Add CBOs serving immigrant, rural, and other underserved communities

### Medium-Term (Months 7-12)
1. **Language Acceleration:** Move up multilingual timeline or identify interim solutions
2. **Accessibility Audit:** Comprehensive review of digital accessibility and offline pathways
3. **Training Programs:** Develop capacity building for community organizations

### Long-Term (Year 2+)
1. **Global Replication:** Document model for international adaptation
2. **Cross-Sector Expansion:** Apply approach to healthcare, education, housing policy
3. **Community Ownership:** Explore pathways for community governance of local repositories

## Budget Assessment

The $498,000 request is reasonable given scope and team expertise. Personnel allocation (81%) appropriate for infrastructure project. Consider:

- **Increase community engagement budget** from partner grants
- **Add explicit accessibility/language budget line**
- **Include evaluation by community-serving organizations**

---

## Risk Analysis

### Low Risk
- Technical feasibility (proven team, operational pilots)
- Market need (clear evidence of document disappearance problem)
- Sustainability (reasonable revenue model)

### Medium Risk
- Community adoption (needs stronger grassroots engagement)
- Government relations (website crawling may face resistance)
- Competitive landscape (commercial providers may respond)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Proactive government outreach emphasizing public benefit
- Community partnership development beyond current academic focus
- Open source approach reduces competitive threats

## Recommendation: **FUND**

This application represents exactly the kind of infrastructure investment PBIF should support - addressing systemic barriers that affect millions while building sustainable, scalable solutions. The team has proven capacity, the technical approach is sound, and the potential impact is substantial.

The equity concerns raised above are addressable through implementation modifications rather than fundamental design changes. The urgency of the problem (documents disappearing daily) supports moving forward with these improvements incorporated.

**Conditions for funding:**
1. Establish community advisory structure within 90 days
2. Accelerate multilingual timeline or provide interim solutions
3. Include explicit equity metrics in evaluation framework
4. Monthly check-ins on community engagement progress

This project has the potential to become critical infrastructure for equity in America's safety net. With thoughtful implementation focused on community needs, it could transform how vulnerable populations access essential benefits information.
